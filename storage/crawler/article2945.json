Twenty seven per cent said selflessness, 25% chose commitment and 23% said generosity.The opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham will take place on 28 July 2022 and the relay is already under way.It is currently in Pakistan and will spend New Year's Day in the Maldives, before visiting Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and spending four days in India between 12 and 15 January.Once it has returned from the Commonwealth countries, the baton will travel through Scotland for five days, Northern Ireland for four, pass through Wales for five days and will tour England for 25 days. It will be carried by thousands of bearers before the opening ceremony, where the final bearer will return the baton to the Queen.Of the survey respondents, 69% said they believe sport has a positive impact on the community and in particular the mental health and wellbeing of people taking part.Lisa Hampton, head of the Queen's Baton Relay, said it was \"really positive\" so many people already had inspirational figures in their lives.And she said the qualities listed were \"exactly the spirit we want our baton-bearers to represent\".Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MidlandsBBC\/>, Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbcmtd> and Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbc_midlands\/?hl=en>.
