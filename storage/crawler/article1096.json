{"author":"","title":"Grace Kamara body: New funeral for woman buried in wrong grave","news_category":"general","content":"The funeral of a woman whose body was exhumed from the grave of a former paratrooper has been held.Grace Kamara's body was mistakenly buried at the Northern Cemetery in Hull in 2000 instead of that of Christopher Alder, 37.The error went unnoticed until November last year when Mr Alder's body was found in a mortuary.The funeral was held at St Charles Catholic Church in Hull, three months after the body was exhumed.South Yorkshire Police is investigating how the mix-up happened.Ms Kamara, 77, died from natural causes in 1999.Her burial was delayed and then finally scheduled for 4 November 2011 when the mistake was uncovered.Thirty specialists were involved in the exhumation overnight on 21 February.Mr Alder choked to death at Queen's Gardens police station soon after he was arrested in 1998.Ten years ago, a coroner's jury decided Mr Alder was unlawfully killed, and misconduct and manslaughter charges were later brought against five Humberside Police officers.They were acquitted of all criminal charges in 2002.In 2006, an Independent Police Complaints Commission report said four of the officers present in the custody suite when Mr Alder died were guilty of the \"most serious neglect of duty\".But the Police Federation said the officers \"strongly disputed\" the report's conclusions."}
