It is by far the biggest regret of my life.\"His wife also issued a statement saying she accepted his apology.Accepting a caution is an admission of guilt and details will be retained in police records.The MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr said in a Facebook post in Welsh: \"The last few months have been hellish.\"Tonight I listened to music for the first time in a while. It's the small things that offer hope of an escape from the depths.\"Mr Edwards referred himself to the party's internal disciplinary committee following his initial arrest."}
