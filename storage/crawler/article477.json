{"author":"","title":"What is a recession and how could it affect me?","news_category":"general","content":"The UK will avoid going into recession in 2023 but the economy is still expected to shrink by 0.2%, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).But the government's independent forecaster also said household incomes - once rising prices were taken into account -would drop by 6% this year and next, the largest two-year fall in living standards since the 1950s <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-64963869>. In normal times, a country's economy grows. People's incomes tend to rise as the value of the goods and services the country produces - itsGross Domestic Product (GDP) <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-13200758> - increases.But sometimes the level of GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly.A recession is usually defined as when GDP falls for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row.The last time the UK's economy went into recession was in 2020 <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-53748278>, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says the UK economy grew by 0.1% between October and December 2022 compared with the previous three-month period.It also revised up its estimate for the performance in the previous quarter, which it now says saw a 0.1% fall in GDP rather than its earlier estimate of a 0.2% fall.The OBR, which provides independent advice to the government <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/explainers-63159607>, now expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.2% in 2023 <https:\/\/obr.uk\/economic-and-fiscal-outlooks\/> but is not predicting falls in two successive three-month periods, meaning, technically, the country will not go into recession.It then thinks the economy will grow by:Despite avoiding a recession, the UK is the only country in the G7 with an economy that is smaller than it was before the pandemic.For most people, economic growth is good. It usually means there are more jobs. Companies are more profitable and can pay employees and shareholders more.The higher wages and larger profits seen in a growing economy also generate more money for the government in taxes.It can choose to spend more on benefits, public services and government workers' wages, or cut taxes.When the economy shrinks, these things can go into reverse - but governments normally do still have a choice on public spending.Other economies are struggling, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - an international organisation with 190 member countries.However, it expects the UK to be the only major economy to shrink in 2023 <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-64452995>.It predicts the UK will perform worse than other advanced economies, including Russia, as the cost of living continues to hit households.High energy prices, rising mortgage costs and increased taxes, and persistent worker shortages are dragging on the UK economy,the IMF said <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-64452995>.Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Graduates and school leavers could find it harder to get their first job.Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases.However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase.Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle.When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called \"stagflation\", which is very difficult to solve.When a country is in a recession, the Bank of England - which is independent of government - would usually be expected to cut interest rates.This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and growth.However, with prices rising so quickly, the Bank has chosen to increase interest rates instead.The recession in 2020 only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% reduction in the UK economy between April and June that year was the largest on record.The previous recession started in 2008 due to the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters."}
