Some are also injured by fishing nets and die.As a consequence, they are protected throughout the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which makes it illegal to feed or harass them.Dolphins are one of the most intelligent animals on the planet. The US military uses them to locate underwater mines and identify enemy military personnel."}
