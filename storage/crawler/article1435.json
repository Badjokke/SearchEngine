They are exhausted, they are crying for help. They have no explanation for what's going on.\"But she added that the people she had spoken to in Ukraine were \"very grateful\" for the support shown.Ricky Wright from Rhondda, who was at the rally, said: \"I've got relatives in Ukraine and I just feel angry.\"Then the sadness kicks in and then I think there's this sort of unity in wanting to do something, regardless of what that is.\"Due to the unfolding events in Ukraine, the Senedd has cancelled Tuesday's St David's Day event, which was set to feature performances from artists throughout Wales.Speaking to BBC Radio Wales earlier on Monday, Mr Price said he hoped a display of solidarity would give the Ukrainian people \"strength and hope\".\"I have friends in Kyiv and I spoke to some of them this afternoon, their message is 'tell people in Wales - don't be afraid of Putin.
