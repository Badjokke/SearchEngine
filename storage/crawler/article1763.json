He told the BBC the ambiguity around his job was \"strange\" and \"extremely stressful\".\"I opened my computer on Sunday morning nine days ago and saw that the screen was grey and locked, indicating that I had been locked out of my Twitter accounts\", he said.\"After a few days had passed I started reaching out to people, including Elon and the head of HR to ask about my situation.\"The head of HR has since twice emailed me and has not been able to answer whether or not I am an employee at Twitter.\"Frustrated, he tweeted his top boss, Elon Musk.This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is my retirement fund, a way to take care of myself and my family as my disease progresses. Having the richest man in the world on the other end of this, potentially refusing to stand by contracts is not easy for me to accept,\" he said.Last month, Elon Musk appeared to fire another 200 Twitter employees. It means that Twitter now has just over 2,000 workers - down from approximately 7,500 in October.\"Companies let people go, that's within their rights,\" Mr Thorleifsson said. \"They usually tell people about it but that's seemingly the optional part at Twitter now\".James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.
