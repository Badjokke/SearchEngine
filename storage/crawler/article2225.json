I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.\"In his resignation letter, seen by AP news agency, Mr McGurk said that IS militants in Syria were on the run but not yet defeated <https:\/\/apnews.com\/a6be8c68c6b147549083da125d118446>. He said that withdrawing US forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS.In an email to staff quoted by the New York Times, he said Mr Trump's decision to pull out troops \"came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy\". It \"left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered\", he said.\"I ultimately concluded I could not carry out these new instructions and maintain my integrity <https:\/\/twitter.com\/rcallimachi\/status\/1076520647038324736>,\" he went on to say.Mr Trump announced his decision to withdraw some 2,000 US troops from Syria on Wednesday, asserting that IS had been defeated.On Saturday, he continued to insist that the decision to pull out was the right one and that, now that IS was defeated on the ground, other players could take care of the situation.This article contains content provided by Twitter.
