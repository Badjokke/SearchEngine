{"author":"","title":"Syria conflict: Trump slows down troop withdrawal","news_category":"general","content":"US President Donald Trump has now said the abrupt withdrawal of US troops from Syria he announced earlier this month will be carried out \"slowly\".\"We're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting Isis [Islamic State] remnants,\" he tweeted on Monday.His clarification confirmed remarks by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.When Mr Trump first announced the move, he had said: \"They're all coming back and they're coming back now.\"The development had shocked US allies and American defence officials alike, with Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and a top US official in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group, Brett McGurk, resigning soon after.America's Kurdish allies on the ground in north-east Syria have been left feeling exposed as Turkey, which regards them as terrorists, appears poised to move against them.The Kurds appealed to Syrian government forces for help to secure a key northern city, Manbij, to guard against any Turkish offensive.Syrian government forces could be seen taking up position near the city on Sunday but, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, they later pulled out \"in order to avoid any frictions\" with US forces in the area.Some 2,000 US military personnel are believed to be in Syria although the real numbers could be higher.After the president made his announcement on 19 December, US officials said American forces had been given 30 days to leave Syria.In his announcement, Mr Trump had also declared that IS had been \"defeated\". <https:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/1075528854402256896>However, on Monday, he said troops were being pulled out \"slowly\" and that they would be fighting remaining IS militants at the same time.This article contains content provided by Twitter.
