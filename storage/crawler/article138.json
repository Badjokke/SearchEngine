The closing date is 11 April.The square has also been chosen by the National Trust among locations for a Blossom Picnic. People are invited to enjoy their lunch among the blooms on Saturday 1 April.The following day, the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group will perform a free concert in the square at 15:00 BST.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MidlandsBBC\/>, Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbcmtd> and Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbc_midlands\/?hl=en>.
