So I found out over FaceTime that he had gone.\"Mrs Corbett, who was born without hearing, is now calling for all emergency workers to have sign language training and a fully charged iPad so that they can connect to a qualified interpreter instantly.She is also hoping to raise Â£60,000 for Royal School for the Deaf Derby, which her husband - who was also deaf - had attended and where she works as a teaching assistant.She said once the paramedics had realised she was deaf, they had removed their facemasks.\"But for a deaf person in such a stressful situation it was very difficult to lipread, despite their efforts,\" she said.A post mortem revealed Mr Corbett had had a blood clot which caused a fatal heart attack.The dad-of-two, who had worked at Toyota for almost 30 years, died on 15 June.Craig Whyles, divisional director for Derbyshire at EMAS said: \"We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the patient's family and I am deeply sorry for the poor experience they had with our service.\"We would like to speak to the patient's family about their experience and urge them to get in touch with us at their earliest convenience.\"As an organisation we are currently working with the Nottinghamshire Deaf Society to discuss how we can improve our education to staff around deaf awareness and common emergency communication problems.\"Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbceastmids\/>, onTwitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbcemt>, or on Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbceastmidlands\/>.
