He probably saw what was happening and thought about his own child.\"Luke and his family are now fundraising to pay for supplies to help refugees on their long journey to Poland.\"They need to buy things like protein bars and chocolate, and foil blankets. People are having to walk miles and it's freezing cold.\" He said he didn't know how long Keiran was likely to stay in Poland.\"When he first went, I really didn't want him to go.
