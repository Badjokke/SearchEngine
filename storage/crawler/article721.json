Earlier this month, Nvidia and AMD were told by US officials to stop the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China.Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called the restrictions a \"gut punch\" for Nvidia.\"This is really a shot across the bow at China and it's really going to fan those flames in terms of geopolitical (tensions),\" Mr Ives had told teh BBC.This video can not be playedWatch: How the semiconductor shortage could be a problem for you"}
