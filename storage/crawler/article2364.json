A recent US report said there were still as many as 14,000 IS militants in Syria <https:\/\/media.defense.gov\/2018\/Aug\/06\/2001950941\/-1\/-1\/1\/FY2018_LIG_OCO_OIR3_JUN2018_508.PDF> and even more in neighbouring Iraq - and there is a fear they will shift to guerrilla tactics in an attempt to rebuild their network.But the partnership between the US and the Kurds has enraged neighbouring Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia - the main fighting force in the SDF - as an extension of a banned Kurdish group fighting for autonomy in Turkey.On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country might soon start a new military operation against the YPG in Syria.Mr Erdogan added that he had discussed his plan with Mr Trump by telephone and that he had given a \"positive response\"."}
