Covid is causing some issues but nothing like last January.\"That was truly hell on earth but obviously we are now having to deal with normal acute care plus elective backlogs.\"Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust said: \"The Omicron variant is affecting people across the community including NHS staff, which is leading to higher levels of staff absence.\"Our staff are working tirelessly to minimise the impact of this and we have robust plans in place to ensure that patients who urgently need our care continue to receive it.\"Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbcnewseast\/>, Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbceastofengland\/> and Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbclookeast>.
