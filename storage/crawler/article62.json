It was a state of disbelief.\"Once the whole team had caught up, technical director Sam McGarry stepped forwardto make the acceptance speech <https:\/\/twitter.com\/BAFTAGames\/status\/1641550211624361986>.Overall, the gaming Baftas were a good night for independent titles, with Rollerdrome, Tunic and Immortality among the other award winners.Mathew says it feels \"amazing\" to be recognised on such a big stage, but that all the nominees - big and small - \"deserved to be there\".\"It makes for a nice balance,\" he says.Mathew believes the success of Vampire Survivors owes a lot to its thriving online community, whose feedback helps to shape updates and new content.A second expansion pack - Tides of the Foscari - is due for release on 13 April.And the other secret to its success? \"It's just a lot of fun,\" says Mathew.\"You can lose a lot of hours playing it, it's that 'one more time' kind of game.\"Follow Newsbeat on Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCNewsbeat> and YouTube <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCe1Ef-K5jpnRsmVY5hCBhOw>.Listen to Newsbeat live <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sounds\/play\/live:bbc_radio_one> at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere <http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b006wkry\/episodes\/player>."}
