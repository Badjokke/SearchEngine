I am more lucky than people in Walcott andHemsby <http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-norfolk-25254808> who did not have time to recover belongings.\"She said she had been prepared to lose the house and had been negotiating with North Norfolk District Council about its demolition in April next year.Now she is going to stay at a friend's house nearby while they are away.\"It's an incredibly sad day,\" she said, as the demolition team moved in."}
