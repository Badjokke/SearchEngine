{"author":"","title":"Cardiff care leavers in council tax exemption plan","news_category":"general","content":"Cardiff could become the next council in Wales to exempt people leaving the care system from paying council tax.In October, Torfaen voted to approve such an exemption <http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-wales-south-east-wales-41594064>, which will begin from the next tax year in April 2018.A report said care leavers could find managing their own budgets extremely challenging, leaving them at risk of falling into debt.Councillors are discussing a proposal on Thursday which, if approved, will be sent to cabinet for further scrutiny.The Children's Society said in its 2016 report <https:\/\/www.childrenssociety.org.uk\/sites\/default\/files\/pcr073_care-leavers-financial-exclusion-final.pdf> care leavers should be exempt from paying council tax until the age of 25.In Torfaen, they will not have to pay the charge until they turn 21. It is expected to affect about 30 people in the county.At present, all councils in Scotland exempt care leavers from council tax along with 33 councils in England.The measure is also supported by the Children's Commissioner for Wales, Sally Holland, as expressed in herHidden Ambitions report <https:\/\/www.childcomwales.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Hidden-Ambitions.pdf>.The Welsh Local Government Association discussed its own report <http:\/\/www.wlga.wales\/SharedFiles\/Download.aspx?pageid=62&mid=665&fileid=1268> at a meeting in October, which noted the growing use of exemptions across the UK and its recent adoption by Torfaen.Members agreed to raise the matter within their own authorities at a later date."}
