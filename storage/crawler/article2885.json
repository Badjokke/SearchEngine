Not only are they an overt abuse of our immigration laws, but they risk lives and hinder our ability to help refugees who come to the UK through safe and legal routes.\"The Nationality and Borders Act will fix our broken immigration system by protecting those in genuine need while cracking down on the evil people-smuggling gangs responsible for these life-threatening journeys.\"By Simon Jones, BBC South EastIt's been another busy day for the Border Force and Ministry of Defence in Dover.We saw a couple of boats being brought to shore.

It is thought to be aimed mostly at single young migrants who arrive through \"illegal, dangerous or unnecessary methods,\" such as on small boats or lorries.In 2021, 75% of all small boat arrivals were men aged 18 to 39 <https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2021\/irregular-migration-to-the-uk-year-ending-december-2021>, according to Home Office figures.Rwanda would take responsibility for those sent there and has said migrants would be \"entitled to full protection under Rwandan law\" with equal access to employment and services.The government spokesman said: \"Under our new Migration and Economic Development Partnership with Rwanda, those making dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys may be relocated there to have their claims considered and to rebuild their lives, with the first flight expected to take place on 14 June.\"Follow BBC South East on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BBCSE\/>, on Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbcsoutheast>, and on Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbcsoutheast\/>.
