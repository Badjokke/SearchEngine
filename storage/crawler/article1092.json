Handelsbanken expects house prices to fall 10% in 2023.Thomas Pugh, an economist at auditing firm RSM, also predicted a 10% drop in house prices as mortgage approvals continue to fall.In November, the actual interest rate paid on new mortgages increased by 0.26 percentage points to 3.35%.This is likely to increase further, Mr Pugh said, \"leading to a further slump in new mortgage approvals\".He added that households put £5.7bn into bank and building society accounts in November.\"This suggests that very weak consumer confidence is still prompting households to spend less and save more in anticipation of tough economic times ahead,\" he said.Credit card debt increased by £1.2bn and debt charity StepChange said the figures show that rising prices \"are forcing people to turn to credit to get by\" in the run-up to Christmas.\"With further net borrowing increases expected following the festive period, there is potential for an increase in the number of people vulnerable to problem debt,\" the charity said.Households also stepped up borrowing against their homes in November as costs continued to spiral.After taking into account old loans that had been paid off, people borrowed an additional £4.4bn against their homes, compared to £3.6bn in October, the Bank of England found.Have you postponed buying a house due to higher mortgage rates?
