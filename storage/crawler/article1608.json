They contributed to a total of more than 16,000 lost hours across the West Midlands that month.WMAS deputy chair Wendy Farrington-Chadd said it was \"disappointing\" adding the trust should be \"pushing more for solutions\".Meanwhile, hospitals in England have been ordered to \"eliminate\" ambulance queues outside hospitals following the death at Worcestershire Royal Hospital and another death of a patientin an ambulance outside Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridgeshire <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-cambridgeshire-59056508>.A letter from NHS England to all acute hospitals stated handover delays represent \"unacceptable clinical risk\" for both for patients waiting in ambulance queues and those in the community whose emergency care is delayed.Martin Flaherty, managing director of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said the ambulance sector is experiencing \"some of the highest levels of emergency activity in its history\" and the association \"remains extremely concerned about the unprecedented levels of hospital handover delays which are occurring across the UK\".Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MidlandsBBC\/>, Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbcmtd> and Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbc_midlands\/?hl=en>.
