It said it would be working with the club until it was content its safeguarding and welfare policies were embedded in club governance.Some coaches were suspended <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-shropshire-57898610> following the probe into welfare issues raised by parents of members. The move led to a letter of support from some past and present swimmers for those suspended.But a Swim England spokesperson added at the time the suspended coaching staff would not return until all conditions set out had been met.The separate school inspectors' report said Ellesmere College's annual safeguarding review did not include adequate consideration of pupils taking part in club activities.It added the school did not make effective assessments of the potential risks of students' participation.\"The school fails to ensure that it provides a safe environment in which children can learn while they are taking part in the activities of the swimming club which the school permits to use its facilities and which it enables pupils to join,\" the inspectors said.Their report, which also criticises the school's leadership, gave Ellesmere College four actions to implement, including ensuring children who participate in swimming do so in a safe environment, to assess risks related to participating in the club and actively promote the well-being of pupils, especially those participating in the swimming club.In a letter to parents, head teacher Brendan Wignall wrote the issues related \"specifically to procedural matters in respect of the relationship between the college and the Titans\".Mr Wignall said the school's action plan included formally reviewing Titans' policies and procedures with regard to safeguarding.He said the minute-taking system for school council meetings on safeguarding matters, related to outside clubs, would be revised to include greater detail.Written risk assessments, he said, would be put in place to assess any potential risks in relation to pupils being club members.In his letter, Mr Wignall said the school was looking into taking over management of the Titans.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MidlandsBBC\/>, Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbcmtd> and Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbc_midlands\/?hl=en>.
