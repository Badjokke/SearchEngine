Every single councillor has been extremely supportive, and the previous mayor has called me when he has seen that I have been getting hate online, and he has said he is there if I need him. It has been really nice.\"Despite being \"difficult\" and \"disheartening\", Owen said they found the stupidity of some of the abuse they received funny.\"They may say I have low testosterone or I am effeminate or I look like a woman,\" they explained.\"I am like, 'oh my God, you are trying to insult me by calling me feminine, even though I am explicitly telling you that I have feminine traits, that I want to celebrate because I am non-binary?'\"As I said, there is a fantastic team of councillors and friends who support me through that, and if I get hate comments, it is worth it when I get all the nice comments as well, or know that I have helped one individual person feel more comfortable in their own skin.\""}
