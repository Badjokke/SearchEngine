But over in Taiwan and South Korea, animal activists have lavished praise on leaders Tsai Ing-wen and Moon Jae-in, for choosing to adopt rescued animals instead of buying pets.Taiwanese leader Tsai's love for cats is well documented. The 59-year-old, who won a landslide victory in 2016 to become the island's first female president, has two adopted cats of her own named Think Think (a grey tabby taken in after a typhoon) and Ah Tsai (a farm cat and gift during the presidential election).While Ms Tsai has also taken in three retired guide dogs, both her cats have hada longer following <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Think_Think_and_Ah_Tsai> among supporters, who regularly look forward to comic appearances from the adorable duo.To many South Koreans, their new president Moon Jae-in came as a breath of fresh air. Especially withhis choice of presidential animals, which has inspired fan art <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BQZ7k-DDTKp\/?taken-by=moonjaein>. For starters, all of his pets were from shelters. A stark contrast with his disgraced predecessor Park Geun-hye, who ownednine pedigree Jindo dogs <http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-39275886> but was accused of abandoning them when a widespread political corruption scandal uprooted her from office.Making good on one of his election promises, Mr Moon challenged a local taboo that has led to discrimination against black dogs, by adopting one from an animal sanctuary.He named the black mongrel Tory, and the move was hailed as supporting animal rights in South Korea.The lucky pooch joins the president's two other pets - a dog called \"Maru\" and a former shelter cat named \"Jjing-jjing\"."}
