{"author":"By Daniel Rosney","title":"BBC local radio: Government 'concerned and disappointed' by planned cuts","news_category":"general","content":"The government has said it is \"concerned\" and \"disappointed\" by planned cuts to BBC local radio output.Media minister Julia Lopez said there would be \"serious questions\" if the move to merge some programmes meant local content was not being delivered.Under proposals announced <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-63455192> on Monday, the 39 local radio stations in England would share more shows.The BBC said the plans would prioritise digital content and \"grow the value we deliver to local audiences everywhere\".Local radio stations would keep their own schedules from 6am to 2pm but usually share programming after that, including having a single \"all-England\" show from 10pm.The broadcaster said the reorganisation would create 11 investigative reporting teams across the country, with a priority on digital content, focusing on key local issues.Ms Lopez acknowledged the BBC was \"operationally and editorially independent from the government\", but told the House of Commons that local radio \"plays a vital role in reflecting local experiences and delivering local news\".She said: \"For those older residents living in rural areas, it can be a particular lifeline. The BBC must make sure it continues to provide distinctive and genuinely local radio services with content that reflects and represents people and communities from all corners of the UK.\"We recognise in the current fiscal context the BBC, like other organisations, is facing difficult financial decisions.\"But we are also concerned that the BBC is making such far-reaching decisions, particularly about its local news provision, without setting out further detail on how it will impact its audiences and the communities it serves.\"Ms Lopez said she would raise her concerns when she meets the BBC's chairman and director general next week.Some local radio presenters took to social media to say they had been placed at risk of redundancy.This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The consequence of this instability is now showing.\"In January, the licence fee was frozen at £159 <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-60027436> for the next two years by the government, which director general Tim Davie said would result in a £285m funding gap in the final year of the BBC's current royal charter in 2027. There is a debate about whether the licence fee will be scrapped after that."}
