He's not even been in there three weeks.\"Solar lights had also been taken from three other children's graves nearby, she added.The burial ground's rules state the placing of \"unusual or inappropriate\" items on graves is discouraged to keep up its \"harmonious appearance\".However, Ms Spackman said she had been told by Brockworth Parish Council that it was not responsible for the removal of the items."}
