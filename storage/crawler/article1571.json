{"author":"","title":"Why is raw sewage pumped into the sea?","news_category":"general","content":"Pollution warnings for dozens of beaches in England and Wales were issued after water companies discharged untreated sewage and wastewater into the sea.It has led to calls for action to keep the sea and beaches clean.Most of the UK has a combined sewerage system, meaning that both rainwater and wastewater - from toilets, bathrooms and kitchens - are carried in the same pipes.Usually, all the waste is carried to a sewage treatment works.But the Environment Agency (EA), which covers England, says capacity can sometimes be exceeded during heavy rainfall, especially when dry ground is unable to quickly absorb water.This could lead to inundation of sewage works and potential flooding of homes, roads and open spaces.For this reason, the system is designed to overflow occasionally and discharge excess wastewater into the sea and rivers.This practice is known as combined sewer overflows  <https:\/\/environmentagency.blog.gov.uk\/2020\/07\/02\/combined-sewer-overflows-explained\/>(CSOs) and is permitted.The EA requires water companies to monitor the overflows and they can be investigated and fined if they fail to meet certain requirements.Last year Southern Water was fined £90m <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-kent-57777935> for dumping billions of litres of untreated sewage into the sea in Hampshire, Kent and West Sussex.Data shows the use of overflows is not occasional, as it is meant to be. Raw sewage was pumped into rivers and seas about 375,000 times in 2021 <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/science-environment-56590219>, the Environment Agency says.In 2022, Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales, launched cases against six water companies over discharging sewage at times when this should not have happened.The Environment Agency (EA) monitors pollution across England. It says that between May and September \"weekly assessments measure current water quality, and at a number of sites daily pollution risk forecasts are issued\". You cansearch their website <http:\/\/environment.data.gov.uk\/bwq\/profiles\/> by location.There are similar websites <https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/quality-of-local-bathing-water> where you can find out about beaches and bathing water in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.Campaign group Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) has created an interactive map <https:\/\/www.sas.org.uk\/map\/> showing pollution risk warnings along the coast and rivers.Swimmers are warned to stay away when untreated sewage is discharged into the sea.The contaminated water could lead to serious illnesses.Risks include gastrointestinal illnesses, or stomach bugs, which may cause diarrhoea and\/or vomiting, as well as respiratory, skin, ear and eye infections <https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/swim-healthy-leaflet\/swim-healthy#:~:text=Open%20water%20swimming%20can%20increase,cryptosporidium%2C%20will%20generally%20be%20mild.>.Last year, Conservative MPs were criticised <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-59040175> after 256 voted to reject an attempt by the House of Lords to require water companies to reduce sewage discharges.They argued safeguards already existed and that new measures would cost billions.Environment Minister Rebecca Pow told MPs that eliminating storm sewage overflows wouldcost between £150bn and £660bn <https:\/\/hansard.parliament.uk\/Commons\/2021-10-20\/debates\/CE55C8E2-7CAF-40F2-8D93-0DE58EC702F5\/EnvironmentBill#contribution-8696A825-8A09-4ABF-A936-C8C40E04C0D1>. She didn't say how she arrived at the figures.A report by the Environment Agency and Ofwat <https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/1030980\/storm-overflows-evidence-project.pdf> said the separation of wastewater and storm water systems would increase household bills between £569 and £999 per year, as well as being disruptive and complex to deliver.However, it's not clear the Lords' proposal would have required water companies to completely replace the sewerage infrastructure.On 26 August, the government published its Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan <https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/1100606\/Storm_Overflows_Discharge_Reduction_Plan.pdf>. It compels water companies, by 2035, \"to improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water\" and \"75% of overflows discharging to high priority nature sites\".Dr Imogen Napper, a researcher in marine pollution at the University of Plymouth previouslysaid <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/science-environment-62626774> that for government goals to be met, more \"investment and accountability is required from water companies\".A spokesperson for Water UK - a body representing the UK water industry - said water firms \"agree there is an urgent need\" for action and were investing more than £3bn <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-62633559> between 2020 and 2025.Three French members of the European Parliament say they have written to the European Commission <https:\/\/twitter.com\/Pierre_Ka\/status\/1562493407506812928?s=20&t=_Y-Nm1GrCvA6pW_cxr8TZQ>, asking it to take action to stop the UK from polluting the Channel and North Sea.Since Brexit, they said, the UK \"has chosen to lower its water quality standards\".The UK is no longer bound by EU environmental laws. But those laws were not directly regulating the frequency of number of sewage discharges.According to Friends of the Earth <https:\/\/friendsoftheearth.uk\/system-change\/5-things-you-need-know-about-new-environment-act>, the UK's Environment Act 2021 - which replaced the EU laws - brought \"some useful changes\" which include \"efforts to stop companies filling our waterways with sewage\"."}
