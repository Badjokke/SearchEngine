David said the eviction was \"really unfair\" and caused a lot of stress for the parents-to-be.\"Looking at the options we had as tenants there was very little we could do. It was just really baffling, really confusing, it doesn't seem like a fair process,\" David added, after being outbid or rejected for more than 30 properties they had viewed.\"Soul destroying is the term I'd use for it, it was just rejection after rejection after rejection.\"David and Samira managed to find a new home just in time for the arrival of their daughter Aila last week.The government is due to introduce a Renters' Reform Bill before the summer, which it has said will redress the balance in the market and provide more security for tenants.Housing rules are different in each of the devolved nations, and Scotland and Wales have already banned no fault evictions."}
