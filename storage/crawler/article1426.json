And that's because we chose to leave it as part of Brexit. The BBC has learnt that the Home Office has not sent any failed asylum seekers back to EU states since the end of the Brexit transition three months ago.The home secretary's plans for asylum rely on striking agreements with other safe countries who would be willing to take people who have passed through their territory on the way to the UK.Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs the changes proposed by the government \"risk making the situation even worse for victims of human trafficking as it would make seeking help in the UK even harder\".\"The government policy is defined by a lack of compassion and a lack of competence, the plans risk baking in to the UK system the callousness of this government's approach,\" he said.Responding to Ms Patel's pledges, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon accused the government of \"seeking to unjustly differentiate between the deserving and undeserving refugee\" by giving protection \"based on how they travel to the UK\".Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said it was \"slightly misleading to say people have a choice between the legal and illegal route\" adding \"for many people the clandestine means will be their only way to get to the UK\".She also said there would be \"complex issues\" about whether other countries would be willing to take back asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK via irregular routes.Asked if any EU states had agreed to take people back, Ms Patel replied that she was currently in discussions with those countries.There was support from Conservative MPs in the Commons, including West Bromwich MP Shaun Bailey who said: \"Just like my constituents, I'm angry at the images that we're seeing of small boats coming into the Channel and the sky-rocketing costs of our asylum system.\"The broader issue here is this: our European neighbours need to step up. It's as simple as that.\"This video can not be played'Nobody chooses persecution' - criticism of asylum changes from an asylum seekerThe Home Office said that \"for the first time\" the question of whether asylum seekers enter the UK via another \"safe\" country, such as France would \"have an impact\" on how it dealt with claims.The government would seek the \"rapid removal from the UK\" of rejected applicants, with appeals \"reformed to speed up\" the process, it added.But asylum seekers fleeing persecution or violence and coming to the UK via the \"legal resettlement\" route from countries such as Syria and Iran would straight away get permission to remain in the UK indefinitely, the Home Office said.Under the new plans, anyone who pays criminal gangs to bring them to the UK would only ever receive temporary permission to remain and would be regularly assessed for removal from the UK.Other proposals include bringing in \"rigorous\" age checks to stop adults entering the country by pretending to be children.The use of hotels to accommodate arrivals will end and the government will bring forward plans to expand the \"asylum estate\".Ms Patel said asylum applicants with criminal records who returned to the UK after being deported would receive a jail sentence of up to five years. The current maximum is six months.And people smugglers - responsible for shipping many of the 8,500 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year - could get life sentences."}
