A working class gay man from Birkenhead.He never assimilated. He never attempted to \"straighten up\" or change his persona.And for so many in the LGBT community - who are used to making ourselves smaller or hiding parts of our personality in certain company - that was a game changer.From documentaries, to his own chat shows, the Blind Date reboot and of course his ITV show Love of Dogs, he never dimmed himself down or tried to make himself more palatable for certain audiences.He was unapologetically camp, and bitchy. He was Paul - perhaps, though, always with a hint of Lily\u2026O'Grady was also mentioned by several MPs during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions.Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner and MP Chris Bryant both paid tribute to the entertainer, while deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said Lily Savage \"broke glass ceilings and broke boundaries\".This video can not be playedLabour MP Chris Bryant pays tribute to Paul O'Grady's role in British gay life and makes an unusual offer to Dominic RaabComic Omid Djalili said <https:\/\/twitter.com\/omid9\/status\/1640996174373978112> he was \"just coming to terms with the unexpected passing of Paul O'Grady\".\"I don't think I've ever been so immediately enamoured with a personality on a first meeting. He truly elevated the very atmosphere in which he moved. God rest his mighty soul.\"Presenter and actor Les Dennis described O'Grady <https:\/\/twitter.com\/LesDennis\/status\/1640945030935322624> as \"a true comedy great\", adding: \"His twinkly, mischievous presence will be missed by so many.\"Actor and TV host Rob Brydon said: <https:\/\/twitter.com\/RobBrydon\/status\/1640986926609240066> \"Paul O'Grady was a lovely warm and caring man with a lightning fast and devastating wit.

He was a massive talent, but you can't forget he was a social worker when he was younger, he saved babies and young children from abuse, he lived in Soho before it was gentrified, he never judged the vulnerable, the weak, the misunderstood.\"O'Grady had recently been on tour playing Miss Hannigan in the musical Annie and had been due to present on Boom Radio in less than two weeks time for Easter Sunday.The presenter was born in Birkenhead, on the Wirral, Merseyside, in 1955, to a mother whose maiden name was Savage - which is believed to have inspired his famous drag act.He began performing as Lily Savage in the 1970s. His drag persona later helmed in a solo show that ran for eight years at London's Royal Vauxhall Tavern, and made a name by speaking out about LGBT issues.Later, he hosted chat show The Lily Savage Show for BBC for a short run in 1997, before turning his hand to hosting a revived version of game show Blankety Blank, which remained on air until 2002.O'Grady later hosted teatime programme The Paul O'Grady Show on ITV from 2004 to 2005, before moving with it to Channel 4 from 2006 until 2009. It was later revived in 2013 on ITV and remained on air for two years.During 2013, the chat show was fronted by guest hosts <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-25000088> after he suffered a health scare. He had previously had heart attacks in 2002 and 2006, the latter requiring a stay in intensive care.During his career O'Grady won a TV Bafta, British Comedy Award and a National Television Award for The Paul O'Grady Show.In 2008, he was made an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to entertainment."}
