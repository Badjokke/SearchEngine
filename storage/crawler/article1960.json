It immerses you straight into someone's psyche rather than seeing them from the outside,\" she said.\"They often don't have very complicated plots but it's all about the build-up of suspense and fear, and you have to be completely immersed in the voice.\"Wisdom, who is also on the programming committee for the annual Theakston Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival, which takes place in Harrogate in July, said big names like Lee Child and David Baldacci \"just get bigger and bigger\".And people \"still take comfort from crime novels where bad is punished and good comes through in the end\", she said.\"There's also intrigue, suspense and mystery solving en route.

In the end they make you feel better.\"Source: Nielsen BookscanCrime author Ian Rankin said that as well as having fascinating characters and gripping stories, crime fiction can show us \"the darker side of ourselves\".He told BBC News: \"Crime tells us a lot about our society, it tells us a lot about ourselves as human beings...
