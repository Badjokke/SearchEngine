It's worth over £50bn in the UK each year so we shouldn't be looking at cost, we should be looking at value.\"Mr Kreft said social care needed to be made equal to other health care work.Emma Murray is the manager of At Home - Vale Senior Care, a domiciliary care service in Denbigh, Denbighshire.She manages a team of 10 carers and said the social care sector had reached a \"critical point\".\"You don't want to deliver care that's unsafe.
