Should have result tomorrow am\".Responding on his GB News chat show on Wednesday, Mr Rees-Mogg said \"one of my children needed a test and that put everybody into quarantine\".When he was informed his child's initial test had been lost, \"it was raised with the department of health and they decided to send me a test to a member of my family\", he said.\"So if I received special treatment, it wasn't because I had requested it, but actually it allowed a government minister to get back to work with a child who didn't have Covid in the first place,\" the former business secretary said.He said the Covid testing system had not been working but \"I accept it wasn't working for other people too\".Labour has urged the government to determine whether Mr Rees-Mogg received special treatment and not to \"hide\" behind the Covid inquiry.A spokesman for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The government is more than capable of answering those questions now and ensuring that we can have clarity and transparency on those issues.\"The Liberal Democrats have written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to ask him what he knew and when regarding claims that ministers had access to \"priority testing\".The party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"These reports are just more evidence that it's one rule for Conservative ministers and another for everyone else.\"The government must urgently publish exactly how many Conservative ministers, MPs and their families had access to priority testing when the public faced a national test shortage. The public deserves to know the truth.\"During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said the inquiry was \"the right way for these things to be looked at\" and that he would not comment on \"piecemeal bits of information\".Around the time of the Rees-Mogg messages, Sarah Marsh, director of testing at NHS Test and Trace,tweeted <https:\/\/twitter.com\/SJM_NHS\/status\/1303248829416976384> \"heartfelt apologies to anyone who cannot get a Covid test at present\".This video can not be playedPMQs: Rishi Sunak quizzed on claims of leaked Hancock messages by Sir Keir StarmerIn the same month, media reports said government testing laboratories across the UK were facing a backlog of 185,000 Covid tests.
