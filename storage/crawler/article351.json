Spinner dolphins get their name from their habit of leaping in the air and spinning around.The law applies to spinner dolphins within 2 nautical miles (4 km) of the shore of the main Hawaiian Islands. The rule also applies to boats, canoes, paddleboards and drones.The swimmers were contacted by enforcement officers while they were in the water and alerted them to the violation of federal law.Uniformed officers then met the swimmers on land, the department of natural resources said.A joint federal and state investigation has been launched into the incident.
