She came under heavy scrutiny last summer when a video emerged of her singing, dancing and drinking at a party.Whichever party comes out on top on Sunday evening is likely to have the first opportunity in forming a government. Finland's system of proportional representation requires a coalition to muster more than 100 seats in the 200-seat parliament to run the country."}
