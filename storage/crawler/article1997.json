The sculpture of the computer pioneer and wartime codebreaker now stands on a plinth in the grounds of Sherborne School in Sherborne, Dorset.It comes after local resident Kathryn Ballisat, inspired by Turing's story and connection to the town, commissioned the work.The bust also coincides with the new Â£50 note bearing his image <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-56503741> which entered circulation this week.Sculptor David Williams-Ellis and Turing's nephew Sir John Dermot Turing unveiled the bust.Sir John described the work as the \"best\" statue or sculpture he had ever seen of his uncle and \"inspiring\".Mr Williams-Ellis, who is also behind the sculpture commemorating the D-Day Landings at Ver-sur-Mer <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-57373932>, said he wanted to capture a \"wistful feeling that just doesn't quite tell you the whole story\".The work of Turing helped accelerate Allied efforts to read German Naval messages enciphered with the Enigma machine.
