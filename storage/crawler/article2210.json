Here's what we know:A fishing boat sounded the alarm on Wednesday afternoon after spotting several people in the sea off the northern coast of France.Those who drowned were 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children, France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.A joint search and rescue operation by British and French authorities was launched, and eventually called off late on Wednesday.Two people were rescued and are in a critical condition with severe hypothermia in a French hospital. One of them is from Iraq, the other is Somali, Mr Darmanin told RTL radio.The task of performing autopsies and identifying the victims will take place over the next few days in Lille, in northern France, the city's public prosecutor Carole Etienne confirmed.French media report that the dead are believed to be Iraqi or Iranian Kurds.The cause of the accident remains unknown, but when the long inflatable boat the migrants were using was found by rescuers it was mostly deflated.Mr Darmanin described the boat as a dinghy that was \"extremely fragile\".He said \"it was like a pool you blow up in your garden\".It is the kind of boat often used by people smuggling networks to get migrants across the channel, and has now been sent to Lille to be examined.French police say the boat set out from the Dunkirk area, east of Calais.Fishermen in the area said calm weather had prompted more migrants than usual to attempt the crossing on Wednesday.There are reports that about 25 boats had attempted the crossing during the day.Five alleged traffickers linked to the incident have been arrested in France.Two people have already appeared in court and an investigation into aggravated manslaughter has been opened by prosecutors, Mr Darmanin said.He said the boat used to cross the Channel, called a zodiac, was purchased in Germany.Despite Wednesday's tragedy, people have continued to attempt the dangerous 20 mile (32km) journey across the Channel.
