These proactive steps have helped river and reservoir levels stabilise across our region and recover in Devon,\" Ms Flowerdew said.\"However, in Cornwall reservoir levels remain low. That is why we are asking everyone to help Stop The Drop, so we can restore reservoir reserves, ensuring we have enough water today and into next year.SWW is asking people to aim to drop their water use by 10 litres a day.Advice on doing so includes cutting shower times and turning off the tap when brushing teeth.The incentive is only available for customers within Cornwall where reservoir levels remain low.Reservoir levels in Devon are recovering with average levels in the county now almost three times higher than the current level in Colliford.Follow BBC News South West on Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCSpotlight>, Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbcspotlight> and Instagram <https:\/\/instagram.com\/bbcspotlight>.
