The BBC Sounds Press X to Continue podcast <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sounds\/play\/p098dcz6> has been digging in to the best and worst.\"There are so many video game adaptations that you think are going to be amazing before they come out,\" says Gav Murphy, from RKG Video.\"I was like, 'Assassin's Creed is going to be incredible when it comes out' - and it's just boring. It's joyless.\"Game reviewer and Twitch streamer, Inel Tomlinson, on the other hand, took issue with a listener who wanted to rank Doom as the worst video game adaptation.\"Are you trying to tell me Doom is worse than Dead or Alive?\"It's very fanservice-y,\" he says of the Dead or Alive movie. \"The stuff that you get in the game\u2026 well, you're getting it in the movie.\"This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The recent Sonic the Hedgehog movie has to be in the mix according to Ali.\"It's a good little film. It's not perfect, but I think it's a surprisingly large amount of fun.\"Does it really have a plot? Not so much. Does it make any sense? Nah.
