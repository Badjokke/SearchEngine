Any journalist working in what he calls the fourth branch of power risks sanctions and an international tribunal for \"justifying war crimes\", he warns.Some of Russian President Vladimir Putin's biggest cheerleaders on state-run TV have already faced sanctions, including Vladimir Solovyov who presents a talk show on Russia's biggest channel Rossiya-1, and Margarita Simonyan who has accused anyone ashamed of being Russian at this point of not really being Russian.Russia's state-run channels are required to toe the Kremlin line, so who has quit in response to the war?Hours after Marina Ovsyannikova's on-screen protest, three resignations came to light.Channel One colleague Zhanna Agalakova quit her job as Europe correspondent while two journalists have left rival NTV.Lilia Gildeyeva had worked for the channel as a presenter since 2006 andVadim Glusker had been at NTV for almost 30 years.Rumours abound that journalists have also headed for the door at All-Russia state TV group VGTRK.Journalist Roman Super said people were quitting its Vesti news stable en masse, although that has not been confirmed.

Moscow-based journalistJonny Tickle quit on the same day \"in light of recent events\".French RT presenter Frédéric Taddeï said he was leaving his show because France was \"in open conflict\" with Russia and he could not continue to host his programme Forbidden to Forbid \"out of loyalty to my country\".Days later, the EU said it was banning all of RT's various outlets as well as those of fellow Kremlin outlet Sputnik for their \"campaign of disinformation, information manipulation and distortion of facts\". Russia's German-based state news agencyRuptly has also endured a spate of resignations, according to Reuters news agency.Russia's non-Kremlin media have come under repeated attack for years, so many journalists who have worked under constant threat of losing their livelihoods at independent outlets will be unimpressed by the current crop of resignations.
