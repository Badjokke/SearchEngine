They did an incredible job last time, and presented it beautifully.\"It's very exciting that the exhibition will stay local once more, and hopefully will run without any restrictions, allowing more people to see this beautiful project.\"Money from the first project will be used to kit out a sensory room at Colchester Hospital and redesign the garden area.As well as the auction, it was partly raised through sales of a book featuring the work, with a second book due to be published later this year.Mr Jones said it was his family's way of saying thank you to the doctors who have played a huge part in Noah's life.Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbcnewseast\/>, Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbceastofengland\/> and Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbclookeast>.
