He shot a little nine-year-old child.\"In an interview with BBC News, Ms Corr said Cashman's actions begged the question: \"If someone is like that, would you come forward?\"Thankfully, we had a witness who had the courage of her convictions and wanted justice and she was very, very, brave.\"Ms Corr said that when she assessed the woman's interview with detectives, she found her words to be \"powerful, strong and the bottom line was she was telling the truth\".She explained: \"We had all the independent evidence that corroborated her account - the tracksuit bottoms, the [gunshot residue] on those tracksuit bottoms, the T-shirt, the telephone call to her partner who then came, then we saw him [dropping] Thomas Cashman off.\"Then we had that little clip of CCTV of [a man] then taking what she said was the bag with murder clothes in it to somebody else.\"Ms Corr added: \"She was telling the truth - and it was at that moment I thought, 'Yes, the officers had done enough for me to make my charging decision'.\"Det Supt Baker agreed the witness had been incredibly courageous, especially given \"the levels of fear in the community\".Even though he said officers had obtained 320 pieces of CCTV footage - sometimes only seized following court orders - the senior investigating officer said: \"Without witnesses there is no justice.\"It was \"probably the bravest thing that I've seen in my career in terms of coming forward and providing evidence in court\", he added.Det Supt Baker also said that while there had been a £200,000 reward offered to anybody providing evidence leading to the conviction of Olivia's killer, the witness had not made a claim.\"During the course of the trial... there was an allegation that she was financially driven,\" he said.\"She came to us on 24 August - two days after the murder - before any reward was even offered. She wasn't financially driven.\"She explained herself in open court what her motive was, and she's done it for all the right reasons.\"Because a line had been drawn in the sand in respect of the shooting of a nine-year-old girl in her own house.\"Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook <https:\/\/en-gb.facebook.com\/BBCNW\/>, Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCNWT> and Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbcnorthwest\/>?
