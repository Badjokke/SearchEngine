This has always been her priority.\"A spokesperson for the landlord said: \"We're in conversation with Union Theatre to explore a solution to address their situation.\"Wherever possible we work to retain longstanding customers in our spaces.\"Follow BBC London on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BBCLondon>, Twitter  <https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCLondonNews>and Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbclondon\/?hl=en>.
