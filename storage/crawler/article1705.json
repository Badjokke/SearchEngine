{"author":"By James Gregory","title":"Paul O'Grady signs off final Radio 2 show","news_category":"general","content":"Paul O'Grady has finished his 14-year stint on Radio 2 and confirmed reports it was because he was unhappy about sharing his Sunday afternoon slot.O'Grady has hosted his current show for 13 years, but a recent scheduling change saw Rob Beckett taking over for two three-month stints each year.Ahead of his final show, O'Grady cited the change as the reason he was going.Also leaving the station is his producer Malcolm Prince, whom he jokingly insulted on every show.Speaking to his long-suffering colleague in their 546th and final programme, O'Grady, 67, said the show had been one of the \"longest jobs I've ever held down\", before addressing his listeners to tell them it \"wouldn't have been the same\" without them.Remembering that his initial work for Radio 2 had been as an occasional stand-in presenter 14 years ago before he was handed his current show in 2009, he said: \"I only came to do a few hours for Elaine Paige and look what happened.\"He added that it was time to \"hang up his headphones\" and \"run free\".His last show included many of his popular segments, including providing the recipe for a Hawaiian-style cocktail and paying tribute to listeners' pets that have recently died.After playing his last song, Friends by Bette Midler, he signed off with: \"So you look after yourselves, stay safe and well. Ta-ra everyone.\"O'Grady and Beckett had been swapping over every 13 weeks in the slot, after a shake-up to the station's schedule.Two other big names - Vanessa Feltz and Craig Charles - have been announced in recent months as leaving the station, while Steve Wright is also vacating his weekday afternoon slot to be replaced by Scott Mills. Many other shows have also been moved on the station's schedule.This article contains content provided by Instagram.
