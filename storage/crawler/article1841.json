It is disgusting. There are lumps of poo all over the place, and you can see it in the field as well.\"Following a meeting with Plaid Cymru MS Llyr Gruffudd, Welsh Water said: \"We appreciate the concerns raised by the community and stakeholders in Capel Curig.\"Our latest investigations indicate that during extreme weather, some storm water may be entering our local sewer network from permeable areas such as land drains and run off from fields.\"This should not happen and reduces the capacity of the sewer to deal with such weather events.\"A spokesman said they were already working on the problem and would keep locals informed of progress."}
