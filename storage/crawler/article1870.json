{"author":"","title":"UK citizens are advised not to travel to Russia","news_category":"general","content":"UK citizens have been advised against travelling to Russia due to a lack of flights available and economic problems in the country.The Foreign Office warned Britons in Russia might not be able to fly directly to the UK or via EU countries.It said the value of the rouble had fallen and there were reports of lots of people \"attempting to withdraw their savings from Russian banks\".The advice comes after Russia banned airlines from 36 countries.In a tit-for-tat retaliation to sanctions, the country said it would stop flights from nations including Germany, Spain, Italy and Canada from using its airspace.On its website <https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/foreign-travel-advice\/russia>, the Foreign Office urged people in Russia to \"amend any travel plans accordingly\".It means UK or EU citizens wanting to leave Russia by air would have to travel to a country which has not issued any flight or travel sanctions to Russia to then get a flight directly home.Russia had already barred UK airlines from flying to and across the region after Britain banned Russian airlines, including national airline Aeroflot and private jets, from landing in the UK.The Foreign Office also warned the sharp fall in the Rouble's value meant any Russian currency people held \"may reduce in value over the coming days\" and that foreign nationals in Russia were reported to be having difficulty using ATM and banking services.It also said since Putin's invasion there had been several reports of anti-war protests with a \"heavy police presence\".\"There are reports of increased police presence and ID checks. You should keep your passport with you at all times,\" the Foreign Office said.On Sunday, Europe shut its skies to Russian owned or controlled planes in one of a number of sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.The announcement means all planes, including the private jets of oligarchs, will now be unable to land in, take off from or fly over any EU nation.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also announced he had told all UK ports to not let any Russian \"flagged, registered, owned, controlled, chartered or operated vessels\" to have access.\"I've made clear these vessels are not welcome here,\" he said.
