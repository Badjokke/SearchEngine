That was not the intention,\" Mr Biden said.\"We're back in business, Europe is back in business. And we are going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe.\"In an interview with the BBC's US partner CBS News released on Sunday <https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/france-president-emmanuel-macron-us-relations-60-minutes-2022-12-04\/>, Mr Macron said the issue was \"fixable\", and his discussion with Mr Biden was \"frank and fruitful\".He said weakening Europe's industry was \"not the interest of the U.S. administration and even the U.S. society\"."}
