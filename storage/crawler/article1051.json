There were no known meetings on the days I was partying.\"Ms Marin said she knew she was being filmed, but said she was upset that the footage had become public.\"I trust that people understand that leisure time and work time can be separated,\" she added.One of the world's youngest leaders, Ms Marin makes no secret of partying, and has often been photographed at music festivals.Just last week, she was dubbed the \"coolest prime minister in the world\" by German news outlet Bild.This week, two separate videos emerged where the Finnish leader can be seen partying.The first video, which surfaced on Thursday, <https:\/\/twitter.com\/visegrad24\/status\/1560015797367488517> sparked the initial criticism.In the footage - thought to be taken from social media - she and Finnish celebrities are seen dancing and singing at a house party.The second video, which appeared on Friday, shows Ms Marin dancing with Finnish popstar Olavi Uusivirta.At Friday's news conference, a reporter claimed he seemed to kiss the prime minister on the neck - but she denied that, and said he was talking to her, and possibly kissed her cheek.\"If someone has kissed me on the cheek, there's nothing inappropriate or something I can't handle or tell my husband,\" she said.There has been widespread reporting on the videos in Finnish media - which justified the use of the footage as being in the public interest.But other opposition party politicians have criticised both the prime minister and the media for talking about partying - instead of more important domestic problems.The footage has sparked fierce debate in Finland about the way politicians handle themselves and the amount of privacy afforded to them.Last year Ms Marin apologised for going clubbing after coming into close contact with a Covid-19 case. <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-59577371>"}
