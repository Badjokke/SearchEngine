{"author":"","title":"Suzy Lamplugh: Body find hope for 'closure'","news_category":"general","content":"The sister of a murdered estate agent hopes her body will be found so the family can \"finally have closure\".Suzy Lamplugh, 25, from London, disappeared in July 1986 and was declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994. A body has never been found.Police have been searching the back garden of a house once owned by the mother of prime suspect John Cannan in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham.Lizzie Bingham said the family were \"cautious\" about the latest search.A fourth forensic tent was erected closer to the house, in the garden, of the property on Wednesday.Ms Bingham told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: \"We have seen various police searches over the years so we are cautious.\"But we hope Suzy's body will be found and we can have the closure we really need.\"This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He was known only as \"Mr Kipper\" and was never traced.No-one has ever been charged in connection with the disappearance, but in 2002 police named Cannan as the only suspect.He always denied any involvement and no prosecution has ever been brought, with police citing insufficient evidence.Three days before Ms Lamplugh's disappearance, Cannan, now aged 64, was released from prison, where he had been serving a six-year sentence for rape.He bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of a man with whom the estate agent was seen talking on the day she went missing - thought to be the mysterious Mr Kipper.According to reports, Cannan was nicknamed Kipper while serving his earlier sentence.In 1989, Cannan was jailed for life for the abduction and murder of Bristol newlywed Shirley Banks and two further rapes.Two sites in Worcestershire - a former Army barracks and a field outside the village of Drakes Broughton <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-10923257> - and a woodland in the Quantock Hills, Somerset, have also been searched in the hunt for Ms Lamplugh's body."}
