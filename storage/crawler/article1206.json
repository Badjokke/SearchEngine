Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war despite the end of the Korean War in 1953 - have markedly improved in recent months.Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.It came after a historic meeting between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump in Singapore in June in which the pair agreed in broad terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula."}
