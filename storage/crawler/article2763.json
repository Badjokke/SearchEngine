It promised that the indictment would \"backfire\" on President Joe Biden and the Democrats.At least so far, the White House has been keeping a studious silence on the matter - similar to the strategy it employed during Mr Trump's 2021 Senate impeachment trial after the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.Their view, perhaps, aligns with the old Napoleon quote about not interrupting an enemy when they're making a mistake.Other Democrats, however, have been less reticent. \"The bedrock of our legal system is the principle that justice applies to everyone equally,\" Democratic Senator Cory Booker said in a statement. \"No-one is above the law.\"The Democratic National Committee's press secretary tried to link Mr Trump and his legal troubles to the former president's \"Make America Great Again\" movement and the Republican Party as a whole.Democrats, and many political analysts, attribute the party's better-than-expected performance in last year's mid-term elections to Republican candidates being too closely associated with a former president who, while still loved by many Republicans, is disliked by a majority of Americans.Expect Democrats to once again employ a similar line of attack.Mr Trump's current legal drama may reach a crescendo and conclude well before a vote is cast in 2024. The political fallout could ultimately depend on the course it tracks - and whether this case is joined by others.For the moment, however, the partisan lines on Mr Trump's indictment are clearly drawn - as they have been on almost every major issue of national importance in America today."}
