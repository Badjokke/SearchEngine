But it is also tackling huge, social, economic and environmental problems.Home to some of the world's most ancient surviving civilisations, the Indian subcontinent - from the mountainous Afghan frontier to the jungles of Burma and the coral reefs of the Indian Ocean - is both vast and varied in terms of people, language and cultural traditions.President: Droupadi MurmuDroupadi Murmu was sworn in as president in July 2022. A teacher and former governor of Jharkhand State, she is the first person from a tribal community to serve as India's head of state. She is a member of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but can play a significant role if, for example, no party wins an outright majority in elections.Prime Minister: Narendra ModiHindu nationalist Narendra Modi stormed to power on a surge of popular expectation and anger at corruption and weak growth.Despite Mr Modi's polarising image, his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) scored an unprecedented landslide victory in the May 2014 parliamentary elections.It was the first time in 30 years that a single party had won a clear parliamentary majority.Mr Modi fought on his record as chief minister of the economically successful state of Gujarat, promising to revitalise India's flagging economy.But his time in Gujarat was overshadowed by accusations that he did too little to stop sectarian riots in 2001 that saw more than 1,000 people - mainly Muslims - killed.The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades.Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part.Today it remains one of the most militarised zones in the world. China administers parts of the territory.India has a burgeoning media industry, with broadcast, print and digital media experiencing tremendous growth.There are around 197 million TV households, many of them using satellite or cable. FM radio stations are plentiful but only public All India Radio can produce news.The press scene is lively with thousands of titles.
