Then, he was deported,\" she added.Mr Singh's family says that his work focuses on people's movements in various countries and that he has made documentaries on protests in many countries, including in Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Myanmar, India and Pakistan.In India, he covered protests by farmers against agricultural laws - which were later repealed by the government - and made a documentary on Shaheen Bagh, an iconic protest site in Delhi that became a symbol of the widespread agitation against the country's controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act.His coverage of the devastating second wave of Covid-19 in India had earned him an Emmy nomination.\"It is his award-winning journalism that scares them,\" his mother wrote on Facebook after he was sent back.\"It is the stories that he did and the stories he is capable of. It is the love for his Motherland that they cannot stand. It's not easy to be a Sikh... a journalist, a warrior of truth and justice,\" she added."}
