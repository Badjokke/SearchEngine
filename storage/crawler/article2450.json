Is it copying you? Are you copying it? How do you feel about what it is doing?\"Hour-long slots include a briefing and interview about the experience.Prof Harwood said the robot would eventually be able to speak and there was a practical application in mind.\"It's rudimentary but the potential for it to communicate and be company for people is definitely there,\" she said.\"The aim of it is to put it into care settings, a more a social setting than a private home\"The idea is it reduces loneliness, it increases your desire to want to communicate.\"Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbceastmids\/>, onTwitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbcemt>, or on Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbceastmidlands\/>.
