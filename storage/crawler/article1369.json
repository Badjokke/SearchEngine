{"author":"By Felicity Evans","title":"Jonathan Edwards: MP who assaulted wife should quit, Plaid leader says","news_category":"general","content":"An MP who assaulted his wife should resign and leave Plaid Cymru, according to party leader Adam Price.Jonathan Edwards, the MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, was suspended from the party in the wake of the assault in May 2020, but was recently readmitted.Mr Edwards has said he will not rejoin the Plaid group of MPs at Westminster.His wife, Emma Edwards, had said she was \"appalled\" <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-wales-politics-62507593> after Plaid announced he would be allowed to return to being a Plaid MP.Mr Edwards has criticised senior party figures for \"vindictive and vengeful\" attacks.Mr Price cannot simply expel Mr Edwards from the party because Plaid's internal democratic rules and processes mean the party leader does not have the power to do so.Mr Edwards, who accepted a police caution <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-wales-politics-53205748>, said he will regret his actions on the day of the assault \"to the end of my life\". Details of the incident are unknown.Mr Price said: \"I would like to thank Emma Edwards for speaking out yesterday and for her to know that her voice has been heard.\"I would also like to offer my apology to her and all domestic abuse survivors for the pain this has caused.\"He called on Mr Edwards to \"leave the party\".\"His actions do not represent our values and his position as an MP sends the wrong message out to domestic abuse survivors in Wales and beyond,\" Mr Price said.Mr Edwards was first elected Plaid MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr in 2010. At the last election in 2019 he had a majority of 1,809 over the Conservatives.This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Wednesday they backtracked, after receiving legal advice, and restored the whip. His wife said she was \"disappointed\" at the decision.The couple are getting divorced."}
