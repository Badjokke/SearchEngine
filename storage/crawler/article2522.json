In 2014 villagers put in a £2.3m bid to the government for flood defences but failed to secure funding <http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-norfolk-28462990> after being told by the Coastal Communities Fund that other applications \"offered us a stronger fit\".However, by June 2015 partial sea defences of honeycombed-shaped concrete blocks were put into the dunes after residents raised £70,000, with Norfolk County Council providing a further £50,000."}
