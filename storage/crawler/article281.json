I was reading some really awful, awful stuff about my brother's body in the mortuary and things like that.\"I had to put it down for months and then I'd be having nightmares. I was traumatised by what I was reading.\"It's taken so long to make sense of it all and I still don't have any answers as to who swapped the bodies and why it happened.\"It's appalling and shocking.\"Ms Alder said the documents showed there was \"evidence that was missed\" out of SYP's report.\"[The report] was more about how the mortuary was run, something totally irrelevant to what had happened.\"I want some answers to why this investigation didn't divulge who's responsible, why and how it happened.\"I want to get the truth out and make sure this never ever happens to another family ever again.\"Ms Alder is crowdfunding for the legal challenge and has so far raised more than Â£1,500.On the online fundraising page, she said: \"I do not believe that a thorough investigation was done.\"I believe that those responsible are being deliberately protected and I am determined to challenge this investigation.\"I am determined to get answers and justice for my brother.
