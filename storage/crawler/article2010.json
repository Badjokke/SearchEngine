I regret that my actions took the focus away from this important work.\"He added that the past two years had been \"a period of deep reflection in which I enrolled on a domestic violence awareness course which has helped me understand the impact my action had on others\".Mr Edwards rejoined the party after Plaid's disciplinary panel found he had expressed \"sincere remorse\".But Ms Brown confirmed that after the panel's decision, the NEC voted by a \"significant majority\" to recommend to Plaid's Westminster group that Mr Edwards was not re-admitted.This prompted the resignation of the previous party chairman, Alun Ffred Jones, who disagreed with the NEC's actions.\"The principle of allowing members of the party's ruling executive to discuss a matter of such significance was of the utmost importance,\" Ms Brown said.\"Having received further procedural advice Plaid Cymru has now notified Mr Edwards that the processes relating to his membership of the Westminster group has concluded. The whip has been restored to Mr Edwards.\"She said the NEC would review the party's processes to identify lessons that can be learned in the case and commission an independent review \"to identify the steps required for the party to be truly free from a culture of misogyny, and to actively and meaningfully promote, defend and extend women's participation in Plaid Cymru and wider politics\".A statement issued after the 2020 incident on behalf of Mr Edwards' wife Emma, said she had accepted her husband's apology.The local Plaid Cymru party in Carmarthenshire said: \"We are delighted Jonathan will resume his role as a much valued and respected Plaid Cymru Member of Parliament.\"He has served this constituency with great dignity and integrity for over a decade.\""}
