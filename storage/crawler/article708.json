The White House Gift Shop is already taking pre-orders for Space Force commemorative coins. Once Space Force merchandise hits the Trump campaign store, it won't be long before it starts showing up at Trump rallies.It's a brilliant bit of marketing from the folks who brought you the ubiquitous \"Make America Great Again\" hat.After selecting a logo, people were then asked to donate money to the Trump campaign.The email came hours after Mr Pence gave a speech at the Pentagon, where he argued that the US must invest in creating a new force in order to counter Russian and Chinese operations.Afterwards, in an apparent sign of approval, Mr Trump tweeted: \"Space Force all the way!\"This article contains content provided by Twitter.
