The BBC said it would carry out an independent review of its social media guidelines - and in the meantime Lineker would abide by the current guidelines.The BBC faced criticism from a range of sides over the row, with some Tory MPs questioning whether the licence fee model should come to an end.But senior Conservative Michael Gove defended the BBC and said he was a \"big fan\" of the licence fee.\"I wish the BBC well, I respect its independence,\" he added.Asking an urgent question on the row in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Labour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said the events of the past week \"exposed how susceptible the BBC leadership is to government pressure\".\"This week's sorry saga has raised serious questions about the government's role in upholding BBC impartiality,\" she said. \"They've got their fingerprints all over it.\"She added that Lineker being taken off air for tweeting something \"the government doesn't like\" sounds like \"Putin's Russia\" - a comparison culture minister Julia Lopez described as \"disgraceful\".Ms Lopez told the Commons the government had \"consistently made clear\" the matter was for the BBC to resolve internally, adding that at \"no time have ministers sought to influence BBC decisions\".In the wake of the row, Lineker contacted Twitter owner Elon Musk after a threatening message was sent to his eldest son, George, who had tweeted in support of his father.The Match of the Day presenter has also changed his Twitter profile image, now showing Lineker next to a quote from George Orwell which is engraved on the wall of the BBC's New Broadcasting House."}
