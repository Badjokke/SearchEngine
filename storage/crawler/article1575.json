It's the most important thing for a head of state and head of the military.\"Mr Trump's sudden announcement on Wednesday and Gen Mattis' resignation sparked concern <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-us-canada-46628811> even among Republican supporters of the president.The US special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat IS, Brett McGurk, also quit over the decision. <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-us-canada-46661384>Meanwhile, the French president paid tribute to Gen Mattis, calling him a \"reliable partner\".Mr Macron's remarks are the latest in a series of recent tense exchanges <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-46212727> between the two leaders who are often described as close allies <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-43840965> with a good personal and working relationship.He also stressed the importance of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters credited with playing a major role in the virtual elimination of IS after it overran large swathes of Syria four years ago.\"I call on everyone... not to forget what we owe them,\" he said.The president, who has long pledged to pull troops out of Syria, continued to insist that his decision was the right one and that, now that IS was defeated on the ground, other players could take care of the situation.This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There is a fear they will shift to guerrilla tactics in an attempt to rebuild their network.But the partnership between the US and the Kurds has enraged neighbouring Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia - the main fighting force in the SDF - as an extension of a banned Kurdish group fighting for autonomy in Turkey."}
