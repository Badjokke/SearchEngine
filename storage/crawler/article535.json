A child gunned down inside her own home, where she should have been safest.The case is considered a real low. But it's not a new low for Liverpool. Eerily, exactly 15 years to the very day, 11-year-old Rhys Jones was fatally shot by a stray bullet.Olivia's murder carried the sense of history repeating itself. Maybe that's why it provoked such a strong reaction within the local community.Detectives say that information flowed into their incident room in a volume they haven't experienced before.And even some of those who might have been expected to put up a wall of silence spoke out.Criminals talked about \"a line having been crossed\".During the trial, Cashman, a father-of-two, had told the court he had been at a friend's house where he counted £10,000 in cash and smoked a spliff at around the time of the shooting.But a woman, who had had a fling with Cashman, told the jury he came to her house after the shooting, where he changed his clothes and she heard him say he had \"done Joey\".It can now also be reported that Paul Russell, 41, admitted driving Cashman away from a house where he fled to following Olivia's murder and disposing of his clothing.Russell, of Snowberry Road, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender at a hearing at Liverpool Crown Court in October and will also be sentenced on Monday.Journalists were prevented from reporting his plea until the conclusion of Cashman's trial.Det Supt Mark Baker, the senior investigating officer in the case, said Cashman's actions were \"abhorrent\".He said officers were still \"hunting down\" those who had enabled Olivia's murder and finding the weapons, which had not yet been recovered, was key.\"When he found out that he had shot an innocent young girl, he should have had the courage to stand up and come forward,\" he said.\"Instead, he chose to lie low despite the fact that he was a dad himself.\"He is not worthy of walking the streets of Merseyside, and neither are those who think they can bring fear or intimidation to our communities through the use of firearms.\"Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook <https:\/\/en-gb.facebook.com\/BBCNW\/>, Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCNWT> and Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbcnorthwest\/>?
