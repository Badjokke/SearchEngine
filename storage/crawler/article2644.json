No-one at the White House was given a heads-up,\" she said.She told reporters that Mr Biden had gone to great lengths to preserve the independence of the justice department, adding: \"President Biden believes in the rule of law.\"The raid was first announced on Monday evening in a statement by the former president, who was at Trump Tower in New York City.Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer for Mr Trump, said she had received a call around 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) that the FBI had a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago and that she should come to the property.She said she saw 30 to 40 gloved FBI agents, some in suits and others dressed casually, and around 10 to 15 FBI vehicles, including a rental truck.Ms Halligan told CBS she and another lawyer for Mr Trump were barred from entering the complex, and that the search was divided into three sections: a bedroom, office and storage area.\"Complete overkill,\" she said. \"If they needed documents, they could have asked.\"The Secret Service agents protecting Mr Trump were notified shortly before the warrant was served, an unnamed law enforcement official told CBS.This video can not be playedMar-a-Lago is a private members' club as well as the Trump family's winter getawayIn a fundraising email to supporters on Tuesday, Mr Trump - who is currently at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club - said he and other Republicans were being targeted because of his political influence and \"my dominance in all polls\".\"They are trying to stop the Republican Party and me once more,\" he said, adding: \"The lawlessness, political persecution, and Witch Hunt, must be exposed and stopped.\"Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell released a statement on Tuesday saying the justice department \"should already have provided answers to the American people and must do so immediately\".While many Democrats welcomed the raid, several urged the DoJ to provide more information. Some aired concerns that it could boost support for the former president.\"This could be very useful to him as many people rally around him during this time,\" Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach, where Mar-a-Lago is based, told the BBC. \"Trump will use this to regain his martyr status.\"Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said she first learned of the \"visit\" by FBI agents through public reports on her phone.\"To have a warrant, you need justification,\" she told NBC News. \"And that says that no-one is above the law, not even a president or former president of the United States.\""}
