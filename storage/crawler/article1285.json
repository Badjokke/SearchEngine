Sir Robin lost by 861 votes to 503.Rokshana Fiaz described herself as the \"unity candidate\" insisting other groups within the local Labour Party have also supported her.Sir Robin congratulated Ms Fiaz but described her promises as \"ambitious\" and said he was \"looking forward to seeing\" her implementing them.He also said the local party had \"fallen into internal sniping and disputes often based on untruths\" over the last few months.This article contains content provided by Twitter.
