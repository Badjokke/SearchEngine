That lectern vanished as quickly as she did.In a ceremony filled with formality, Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, and other senior MPsattended the visit of King Charles in Parliament <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-62874346> - the new monarch's first visit as king - on 12 September.

And the Labour party conference in Liverpool <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/av\/uk-politics-63049522> was novel because there was no internal anger. \"There aren't any fights breaking out in the corner,\" one senior figure told me with delight.The Conservative conference in Birmingham, by contrast, was the most astonishing party gathering I have ever been to. I could fill a notebook every 15 minutes. Electric, toxic, volcanic, incredible.
