The gap is a break in the dunes used by the lifeboat crew to access the beach.Mary Withey was not there to witness her home being demolished on Sunday morning.She said on Saturday that she and her partner \"had got what we can\" before the teams moved in.\"I'm not OK with it, it's been my home, I don't want to move... it's very sad,\" said Ms Withey, who lived in her house for four years.Now all three homes have been demolished, a clean-up operation will take place on Monday.All the materials will be taken to recycling centres, Rob Eastaff, head of demolition at the site, said.The 50-year-old said it was \"not pleasant\" demolishing the homes, especially because he remembered going over the dunes to get to the beach as a 10-year-old boy.He said to see the erosion that had happened over the past 40 years was a \"terrible\" thing.Other properties are currently at risk, \"but at the moment we are only engaged in these three\", he added.Lance Martin's property on the south side of the gap is one of those still at risk.Mr Martin, who has lived there for almost six years, rebuilt what he described as his \"dream home\" after dragging it back further in-land.After this weekend, however, he said there was less than 1m left at the back of his house.He had hoped to move it again but there was uncertainty over whether his home could be saved.Jane Beck, head of property and asset management at Great Yarmouth Borough Council, said it was \"extremely sad\" for those involved.\"We're trying to do everything we possibly can to help them through that process,\" Ms Beck said.The beach and surrounding area at Hemsby should be avoided, she added, and she urged people to stay away for their own safety.The only access road to properties on the Marrams has also been cordoned off and is expected to collapse.Great Yarmouth Borough Council's chief executive, Sheila Oxtoby, said the authority was looking to bring some rock on to the beach to protect the road access to a number of other properties as a \"temporary solution\".It is understood 1,900 tonnes of granite are due to arrive on Wednesday.Hemsby Lifeboat coxswain Daniel Hurd, however, said the current situation could have been resolved earlier.He said: \"I just think it's absolutely ridiculous, this has been an emergency for years and it's taken this weekend for them to see it's an emergency to then get a rock berm put on the beach.\"But the council said it was a \"real minefield of making sure that what local government and the authorities do is the correct line of procedure\".Hemsby, near Great Yarmouth, is home to about 3,000 people and was once home to a Pontins holiday camp.Seven bungalows along The Marrams had to be demolished when sandy cliffs washed away in March 2018 <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-norfolk-43472150> and, in December 2013, \"the worst storm surge in 60 years\", destroyed seven homes.Do you live in the area?
