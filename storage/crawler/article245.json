In a tweet on Friday the centre, which promotes women's equality and access to education and employment, said: \"We have had devastating news today that our ESF funding is not being replaced!\"\"This impacts the services in Derry for women and we also lose six skilled amazing staff members today! Disgrace!\"A protest by staff and service users affected by the funding crisis took place in Belfast on Friday.Project worker Sophie Cocault, who was at the protest, said she has \"no idea\" if she will be going to work next week.Ms Cocault works for Full Service Community Network, which provide services to 25 schools in west Belfast.\"Our service is not a luxury,\" she told BBC News NI.\"Our funding is integral to the community - we support children that really need our help.\"Kathleen Lavery, a teacher at Holy Child Primary School in Belfast, said services were at \"crisis point\".\"There are so many services affected by this cut - many people don't understand how many school services are funded this way,\" she said.\"We are being shoved away. It's a disgrace for the children.\"BBC NI spoke to several organisations ahead of the funding announcement. Declan Doherty, chief executive of Derry Youth and Community Workshop, said he had \"no hope whatsoever\" the replacement funding would be enough to keep staff in work.He said 25 of his staff members would lose their jobs on Friday. Sarah Bowden runs the Greater Village Regeneration Trust in south Belfast.The organisation works with young people with complex needs who are not in education, providing them with training, support and a pathway to employment.\"If you came and looked at the young people we worked with, the prospect of losing this service is shameful.\"It's not just training, it's a safe space and a lifeline for these young people.\"Celine McStravick, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (Nicva), said the funding was \"absolutely essential\" to making Northern Ireland society work.She said that ESF was used by 67 members represented by the council and amounted to around 1,700 employees.\"I have been inundated with emails, telephone calls and meetings with our members, who are angry,\" Ms McStravick added. \"They are frustrated. They're feeling disrespected.\"Levelling Up Minister Dehenna Davison said the £57m announcement was an \"important milestone \".\"We are making the most of opportunities outside the European Union to deliver for people in Northern Ireland,\" she said."}
