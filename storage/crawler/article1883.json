We take it very, very seriously.\"Meanwhile, Mr Wallace said Moscow's invasion of Ukraine was not going to plan, with \"significant casualties\" and protests against it in Russia.He said that as a result, Russia's attack was likely to be become \"more violent\" and could see it \"indiscriminately\" bombing Ukrainian cities.Russian President Vladimir Putin is now in a tight spot and that's dangerous.This long-planned invasion of his neighbour is not going to plan, although his forces are making some progress in the south.Beyond Ukraine's borders, the international reaction has been far swifter and more severe than he would have expected, inflicting serious damage on the Russian economy that could end up threatening his authority at home.So what comes next? On the sanctions, Moscow will retaliate in some form - possibly with a major cyber-attack on Western institutions.But Putin's more immediate task is to show he is winning in Ukraine.Barring the unlikely chance of a peace deal, we can expect to see an intensification of the Russian offensive on Ukraine's cities.Judging by previous Russian actions in Chechnya and Syria there will be scant regard for the safety of civilians, and Moscow still has some devastating weapons at its disposal that it has yet to use.The government is looking at measures to support Ukrainian refugees, after its announcement for some family members of British nationals <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-60550238>, according to BBC Political Correspondent Nick Eardley.Russia's military assault has entered its fifth day, with cities across Ukraine on high alert after the capital Kyiv and major centres of Kharkiv and Chernihiv were targeted by Russian forces overnight.All three cities remain under Ukrainian control, but Russia made some progress in the south, taking the port town of Berdyansk, and clashes are ongoing in the strategically important port city of Mariupol.This video can not be playedLiza Grach describes fleeing Ukraine with her 10-month-old baby, but leaving her husband behindThe UK's Ministry of Defence said its latest intelligence <https:\/\/twitter.com\/DefenceHQ\/status\/1498191541675958273?s=20&t=8otYQb2fP1iq3eCWBsWb7w> suggested \"the bulk\" of Russia's forces remained more than 30km (19 miles) north of Kyiv, \"having been slowed by Ukrainian forces\".\"Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance,\" it said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned the next 24 hours will be \"crucial\".Negotiators for Kyiv and Moscow are meeting for talks today on Ukraine's border with Belarus.Mr Zelensky said on Sunday that he did not expect a breakthrough from the talks but said his delegation would attend because of the \"small chance to end the war\".The UN General Assembly - made up of 193 member states - is set to meet later to discuss the situation in Ukraine.After a phone call with Mr Zelensky at the weekend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson saidthings \"are not going all the way of President Putin\" <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-60541505> and Ukrainians had been \"fighting heroically\" and with \"great success\" to repel Russian forces.Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?
