I think it was obvious I was being abused.\"I was punched by one of my parents in front of the social worker, and was removed that way. It was only supposed to be two weeks but then my mum said she didn't want me back.\"Now aged 31, she said being taken away from her abusive environment was the right - and only - option for her.\"I went into a children's home and, on the whole, it was quite good being around children that had been through similar experiences,\" she said.\"It gave me some sort of rules and boundaries, which was probably what I needed. It was good.\"According to figures seen by the BBC, last year in Wales there were 1,120 care orders made by its 22 local authorities between March 2020 and January 2021.That is down from 1,400 the previous year.Christopher Dunn, from Voices for Care Cymru, said the findings were not a surprise.\"We know a high percentage of safeguarding referrals come from education and health settings, and you know those young people weren't visible to those sort of protective adults during lockdowns for very understandable reasons,\" he said.\"You tend to really only understand a story when you directly meet a young person in a safe environment and virtually you just can't get that connection as you can face to face.\"Tayler, from west Wales, said she would not have gone to university if she had not been through the care system from the age of four, along with her sister.\"It's such a shame that some people will have been missed but they don't know any different,\" she said.\"They think what they're going through is OK and that's the worrying thing. That's what's concerning, it's because they don't know what they're going through is neglect or abuse or anything like that.\"The Welsh Local Government Association said it was clear the real impact of coronavirus on children and children's services was \"yet to come\".\"Councils are very concerned about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on vulnerable children\u2026 and are increasingly highlighting concerns about demands that will be placed on services as lockdown measures are eased,\" said one association official.The body said it was continuing to press the Welsh government to ensure funding was in place \"to meet both the increasing demand and pressures in the short term as well as long term\".Ms Hulmes said there needed to be a \"clear route map\" out of lockdown, with guidance on personal protective equipment, to allow social workers to get into homes \"and undertake direct work\".The Welsh government said the pandemic had brought additional complexities to social work and \"this will have a future impact\".It said it was working with councils and partners to \"overcome these challenges\".The UK government said it recognised the \"tireless\" work of social workers during the pandemic.It said it had given councils in England Â£4.6bn \"to help them meet additional demands\" and was working alongside unions and the sector.The Scottish department of health and social care said social workers would have an important role to play as Scotland recovered from the pandemic.It said: \"Workforce planning is underway to ensure that the workforce of the future is recruited, trained and supported to fulfil this role.\"The Northern Ireland Executive said all health and social care trusts had rebuilding plans in place for the resumption of services affected by the pandemic.A spokesperson said: \"The Department of Health has recently invested in an additional 15 places on the OU [Open University] degree in social work programme in recognition of the rising demands on the profession.\""}
