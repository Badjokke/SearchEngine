The funding still needs to be approved by the IMF's executive board.The IMF expects Ukraine's economy to record a slight contraction or growth this year.Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the funding would help the country \"finance all critical expenditure and ensure macroeconomic stability and strengthen our interaction with other international partners\".US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who made a surprise visit to Ukraine last month, said: \"An ambitious and appropriately conditioned IMF programme is critical to underpin Ukraine's reform efforts.\"The US is the IMF's largest shareholder and the biggest contributor to Ukraine in terms of money spent.Earlier this year, President Joe Biden announced nearly half a billion more dollars of US military aid to Ukraine <https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-64656301>. This was on top of the $112bn spent by Congress in 2022 alone.Military aid, which accounts for more than half of US spending on Ukraine, pays for drones, tanks, missiles and other munitions systems as well as training, logistics and intelligence support.Money has continued to pour into the conflict from all over the world since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February.Last week, the IMF said its executive board had approved a rule change to allow funding for countries facing \"exceptionally high uncertainty\".Without mentioning Ukraine, it said the measure applied to countries experiencing \"exogenous shocks that are beyond the control of country authorities and the reach of their economic policies\"."}
