I hold my hands up, I'm a drug dealer.\"I'm not a bad drug dealer who sells Class A drugs, I don't do anything bad.\"I sell cannabis in my local area whereabouts I grew up. Some people might look at that as a bad thing because a drug dealer's a drug dealer.\"I don't look at it as I'm a bad person for doing that.\"He said a woman he had a fling with, who claimed he had gone to her house after the shooting, was a \"woman scorned\".\"This is how low they'd go,\" he added.
