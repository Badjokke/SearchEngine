The Department of Fisheries and Oceans said he had rescued another whale days before, on 5 July. Rescuers like Mr Howlett had \"immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals\", it said.\"There are serious risks involved with any disentanglement attempt. Each situation is unique, and entangled whales can be unpredictable.\"Mr Howlett lived on Campobello Island, a small community on the border with the US, where locals have been paying tribute to the well-known rescue worker.\"There's only 850 people here on Campobello Island now and Joe was a very lively character, he had a great sense of humour,\" mayor Stephen Smarttold the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation <http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/new-brunswick\/campobello-island-killed-rescuing-whales-joe-howlett-1.4198795>.\"Everybody knew Joe Howlett and everybody respected Joe Howlett... it's a big blow.\""}
