And then I was introduced to the big world of esports,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.\"I didn't realise how easy it was to meet people. And I wasn't too bad at it, so it made a difference.\"But being in a male-dominated environment meant Kels wasn't accepted straightaway, with doubts from other men over how good a female player could be.\"People do tend to see gender as an issue, or at least did back then,\" she says.\"So that was quite a struggle. I had to prove myself and it took me a long time to prove myself.\"\"There's a lot of discrimination and you do have to be thick skinned.\"This video can not be playedEsports: Why are there so few professional women gamers?According to esportsearnings.com, there are no female players in the top 400 earners and only a tiny fraction of the millions being won in competitions around the world is going to women.And it took a while for Kels to realise the significance of her qualification for the Challengers Elite.\"I didn't see it as making history, until I woke up [the next day],\" she says.\"And I was like wait a minute a female just qualified for the Elite and that female was me.\"It was incredible.
