Mr Boateng, a Savile Row tailor, has designed a three-piece suit for men while women can choose to wear a dress, skirt or trousers.Staff will be allowed to order different cuts - normal or skinny-fit trousers - and will be able to book a fitting so the uniform is more tailored.As for the jumpsuit, that will be for female check-in staff at first but BA expects cabin crew to be able to wear them by the middle of the year - after further testing.Female cabin crew have already been trying out the new uniform and asked for changes. Emma Carey said: \"The pockets on the apron, for example, were widened after the trial so we had more room for everything we need during meal services on board.\"Engineers also requested tool pockets, and ground handlers asked for glove fabric that could cope with touch screens.Last year, rival airline Virgin Atlantic announced it was taking a \"fluid approach\" to uniforms which allowed staff to choose their clothing \"no matter their gender\".Though it later said the policy did not apply to crew on board the England football team's flight to the World Cup in Qatar, which has been criticised for its treatment of LGBT people.A spokesperson for BA said that although its uniforms were gendered, it has a policy which allows staff who identify as a certain gender to wear that clothing.\"As a colleague, you can chat to us about that and you can wear what you want. We've got a number of transgender colleagues, and have had that policy for decades,\" he said.BA relaxed its dress code last year by allowing male pilots and cabin crew to wear makeup and nail varnish."}
