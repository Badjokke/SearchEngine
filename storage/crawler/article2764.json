{"author":"","title":"Doncaster Sheffield Airport to close despite financial lifeline offer","news_category":"general","content":"Doncaster Sheffield Airport (DSA) is to close after its owner said \"no tangible proposals\" had been received regarding its future ownership.Peel Group said the closure was due to a \"fundamental lack of financial viability\".On Friday, South Yorkshire's political leaders offered public money to keep DSA operating into 2023.But Peel Group said services at the airport, which employs 800 workers, would wind down from 31 October.South Yorkshire's Mayor Oliver Coppard said he was \"devastated by today's announcement\" and angry about the impact the closure would have on local communities.Mr Coppard said a \"big bold offer\" had been made to Peel to allow the \"time and space to bring in the external interest that we know is out there and get a deal done to save DSA\".He said the offer to use \"public money to subsidise Peel Group\" had been made \"quite reluctantly\".\"The Prime Minister, Liz Truss, said herself she wanted to protect DSA, so it's now over to the government to tell us what they might be able to do to keep the airport open,\" he added.The airport, which is used by Tui and Wizz Air, flies to destinations including the Canary Islands, Balearics, Greece, Turkey, Poland and the Baltic countries.Robert Hough, chairman of Peel Airports, said he recognised news of the closure would come as \"a great disappointment to many\".Mr Hough said he was grateful to the airport's staff who he said had always been DSA's \"greatest asset\".He said the immediate priority would be to \"continue engaging closely with them over the next few weeks\".Meanwhile all affected staff at DSA have been offered job interviews by Manchester Airports Group (MAG).A spokesperson said MAG guaranteed interviews for vacancies across its three airports - East Midlands, London Stansted and Manchester.This is a dark day for the newly minted city of Doncaster and the whole of the South Yorkshire region.One of the largest urban conurbations in the country is left without an airport.Owner Peel Group argues that the economics simply do not stack up, and that despite repeated efforts there simply are not enough airlines interested in making Doncaster a base. The critical mass of passengers isn't there.This though is a blow not just to potential passengers, who lose their local airport, but also the 800 workers who now face the prospect of being without employment in the run-up to Christmas.Peel has referred to the potential value of the site for alternative employment - many believe that will be warehousing and light industry with the two-mile runway and associated airport infrastructure consigned to aviation history.Holiday company Tui said it was \"incredibly disappointed\" by the decision to close, adding flights would continue to operate until its final service on 4 November.UK & Ireland managing director Andrew Flintham said: \"We're working closely with our customers and colleagues on the required next steps. Customer communications will be sent to those impacted shortly and we will do everything we can to offer suitable, alternative roles to colleagues.\"Doncaster Chamber of Commerce chief Dan Fell said news of the closure was \"extremely disappointing for Doncaster, South Yorkshire and the northern provinces\".\"There is an incredibly generous offer of support to keep the airport going for 12 months to allow a proper period to find out ways to retain and enhance that unique economic asset, but unfortunately that offer has been refused,\" he said.Mr Fell praised the \"ingenuity and innovation\" people had shown in trying to find solutions to keep the airport open, and said it \"feels like the door has been shut in the faces of those people who found a solution in very difficult circumstances\".A Department for Transport spokesperson said the decision was \"incredibly disappointing\" for passengers and staff, adding: \"We strongly encourage local leaders and Peel Group to work together and find a solution for the site which will benefit local people and the region's economy.\"Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BBCYorkshire\/>, Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbclooknorth> and Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbcyorkshire\/>.
