Will be fixed shortly\".At one point Downdetector, which tracks technical problems across a number of websites, found that more than 5,000 people had reported issues.Some news publishers warned users of issues in interacting with their twitter accounts.Bloomberg tweeted a link to its report on problems with the message \"if you can click this link, Twitter's fixed its bug\".Some third-party services that use a system called an API to exchange data with the platform also suffered issues.Experts have noted that the platform seems to be experiencing more technical issues of late.Following previous problems on 1 March that lasted two hours, Alp Toker, director of internet outage tracker NetBlocks, said Twitter's reliability issues seemed to have increased under Mr Musk's leadership.\"It started shortly before the Musk takeover itself,\" he said, but added: \"The main spike has happened after the takeover, with four to five incidents in a month - which was comparable to what used to happen in a year.\"Twitter has joined other tech giants in cutting significant numbers of staff, includinga fresh round of cuts <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-64784368> just seven days ago, although there is no evidence that this is the cause of the latest problems."}
