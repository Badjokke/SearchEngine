She said SWW had reduced its use of storm overflows by 50% over the bathing season in 2022, adding there was \"still more to do\".She said: \"We know customers really care about bathing waters across the region and we also really care about the environment so it's absolutely critical that we tell our side of the story and we show what we're doing to reduce the use of storm overflows.\"Daniel Green, from Bude, is a regular user of the town's tidal sea pool.He said: \"We love spending time down here all year round and having a nice clean environment on the coastline and in the sea pool is really important.\"Discharging waste into the local area just isn't acceptable really.\"Mr Jupp said real improvement would only come when SWW was able to share its real-time data from storm overflows, expected later this year.He said: \"What's being launched now is a good step forward because it clarifies all the data and also looks back at historical data from the last three years as well but it's not enough.\"I want to see South West Water launching their real-time information which will really help the public decide what they want to do, as quickly as possible.\"Mr Jupp said people in the South West paid the \"highest water bills in the country\".He added: \"We have a one-star rated water company which was fined Â£13m as a result of the government's new laws.\"South West Water need to clean up their act and our water.\"Izzy Ross, campaigns manager for Surfers Against Sewage, said the charity wanted to applaud water companies being more transparent about sewage discharge but she said it did not solve the problem.Ms Ross said: \"We need to actually see a reduction and eventually an end to sewage discharges from these sewage overflow pipes.\"Follow BBC News South West on Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCSpotlight>, Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbcspotlight> and Instagram <https:\/\/instagram.com\/bbcspotlight>.
