{"author":"","title":"Grace Kamara body: Funeral for woman buried in wrong grave","news_category":"general","content":"The funeral of a woman whose body was exhumed from the grave of a former Hull paratrooper will be held next month.Grace Kamara's body was mistakenly buried at the Northern Cemetery in Hull in 2000 instead of that of Christopher Alder, 37.The error went unnoticed until November last year when Mr Alder's body was found in a mortuary.South Yorkshire Police are investigating how the mix-up happened.Ms Kamara, 77, died from natural causes but her burial had been delayed until 4 November 2011 due to family reasons.Her funeral is due to be held on 7 May, three months after her body was exhumed.Thirty specialists were involved in exhuming her body from Mr Alder's grave overnight on 21 February.Mr Alder choked to death at Queen's Gardens police station soon after he was arrested in 1998.Ten years ago, a coroner's jury decided Mr Alder was unlawfully killed, and misconduct and manslaughter charges were later brought against five Humberside Police officers. They were acquitted of all criminal charges in 2002.In 2006, an Independent Police Complaints Commission report said four of the officers present in the custody suite when Mr Alder died were guilty of the \"most serious neglect of duty\".But the Police Federation said the officers \"strongly disputed\" the report's conclusions."}
