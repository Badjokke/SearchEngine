When he came out after praying, people on the street applauded and shouted: \"Long live the Pope!\"During another stop, he exited his vehicle to give chocolate Easter eggs to police officers in his motorcade, AP news agency reported.On Sunday he thanked those who prayed for him during his hospital stay.The pontiff's admission to hospital <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-65117270> came ahead of the busiest week in the Christian calendar.The Holy Week includes a busy schedule of events and services which can be physically demanding.The Argentine pontiff, who marked 10 years as head of the Catholic Church earlier this month, has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21.He has also used a wheelchair in recent months because of problems related to his knee.Wednesday's hospitalisation was his second since 2021 <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-57714250>, when he underwent colon surgery, also at Gemelli.But the Pope has remained active, visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan in February. The previous month, he led the funeral of his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI.Although the pontiff, who has pushed for reforms in the Catholic Church, has previously said he would consider stepping down if his health failed him, he recently confirmed he had no plans to quit.This video can not be playedWatch: The Pope comforted grieving parents as he left Gemelli Hospital2 April, Palm Sunday: 09:30 (07:30 GMT) Papal Mass, 12:00 Sunday Blessing5 April: 09:00 Papal General Audience6 April, Holy Thursday: 09:30 Chrism Mass in St Peter's Basilica7 April, Good Friday: 17:00 Passion of the Lord, 21:15 Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum8 April, Holy Saturday: 20:30 Easter Vigil in St Peter's Basilica9 April, Easter Sunday: 10:00 Easter Sunday Mass, 12:00 Urbi et Orbi in St Peter's Square10 April, Easter Monday: 12:00, Pasquetta in St Peter's Square"}
