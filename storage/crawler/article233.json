Goods are checked to ensure they comply with EU rules when they arrive in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales).Supporters of this plan, including the nationalist Sinn FÃ©in party, say it is necessary to protect the Good Friday Agreement.But unionist parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), say this actually undermines the agreement because it separates them from the rest of the UK.The DUP has refused to take part <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-61794892> in power-sharing until its concerns are addressed.This means there has been no devolved government - set up by the Good Friday Agreement - in Northern Ireland since February <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-60241608>.The UK government has also criticised the protocol, saying it has been \"upsetting the balance of the Good Friday Agreement\".It is trying to ditch parts of the agreement, with new legislation <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-62244003>.This has led to the current stand-off with the EU <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-61809459>, which says the protocol is the \"one and only solution\" to protecting the peace process in Northern Ireland.Negotiations between the UK government and the EU to resolve differences over the protocolare continuing <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-63513824>."}
