There has been no regard for that at all,\" she said.The Really Useful Group, which is owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber and produces, licenses and promotes his shows, said it had made efforts to inform actors prior to the announcement, some via their agents.However, on the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend, many agents would not have been checking their work emails, several actors pointed out on Twitter.In a statement to BBC News, a spokesperson for the Really Useful Group said: \"The entire company working yesterday were told in person after the matinee performance. There was no evening performance so this was not before a show last night.\"At the same time as the company were told, everyone not present was called or emailed by the wider RUG team. Every effort was made to ensure that the message was distributed as widely as possible as quickly as possible but clearly we had to move quickly as news was getting out on social media.\"Lord Lloyd Webber has not personally commented on the way the announcement was handled, but in his initial statement he said he was \"incredibly proud of Cinderella\".\"Not only did it get some of the best reviews of my career, but we led the charge to reopen the West End, ensuring that theatre and live entertainment remained relevant and in the news,\" he said.The composer thanked \"everyone involved\" in the show, adding that it would now be revamped ahead of a Broadway transfer in March 2023.But the disappointment and outrage from stars continued on social media over the following hours.Strictly Come Dancing finalist and TV chef John Whaite said he was due to join the cast in July and take over the role of Prince Charming and that the cancellation was \"heartbreaking\".This article contains content provided by Twitter.
