It spectacularly shows off just how huge this project became.\"It is totally amazing what beauty can be achieved when so many wonderful people come together for a great cause.\"Noah, who has hydrocephalus, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, was painting on pieces of cardboard when his father had the idea.He offered to post out the backgrounds that Noah had created to artists, who would finish them off.Artists from the UK, Colombia, Italy, Spain, France, Sweden, Germany, the US and Australia have all taken part in the project.The family has created a book, called Background Bob, to raise money for the Colchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity <http:\/\/colchesteripswichcharity.org.uk\/supporters-events\/backgroundbob\/> and also plans to auction off the individual paintings next year for the same cause.Mr Jones said it was their way of saying thank you to the doctors who have played \"a huge part\" in Noah's life.He said anyone interested in the project could follow Noah on his Instagram accountbackground_bob. <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/background_bob\/?hl=en>Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook <https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bbcnewseast\/>, Instagram <https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bbceastofengland\/> and Twitter <https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbclookeast>.
