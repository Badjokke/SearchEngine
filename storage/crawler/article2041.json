President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un met in Singapore last June to discuss denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.At the time, Mr Trump claimed this meeting had ended the North Korean nuclear threat:This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump said the group had been defeated.The administration has since agreed to slow down the withdrawal.Acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan however told reporters on Tuesday that IS is close to losing its remaining territory in Syria.\"I'd say 99.5% plus of the IS-controlled territory has been returned to the Syrians. Within a couple of weeks, it'll be 100%,\" he is quoted as saying."}
