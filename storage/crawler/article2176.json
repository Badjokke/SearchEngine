It said at the end of last month <https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/teletext-faces-court-action-unless-it-pays-over-7m-in-refunds> that Teletext faced court action unless it paid more than £7m in refunds.Lastminute.com had been facing legal action in connection with £1m worth of unpaid refunds <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-56022917>, but the CMA said in February <https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/cma-cases\/covid-19-cancellations-package-holidays?=0#lastminutecom-has-now-paid-back-1-million-in-outstanding-refunds-for-package-holidays> that the money had since been repaid.The watchdog has now secured refund commitments from the other firms.People will be able to travel for leisure again from Monday, but holidays to most destinations require a period of quarantine when holidaymakers return home.Portugal is the main holiday destination currently on the \"green list\", but the travel industry is worried that countries could be added or withdrawn at short notice.The government has advised against leisure travel to \"amber list\" countries, but Tui and EasyJet are still planning to offer holidays to some of those destinations.This video can not be playedHow is the race to vaccinate looking around the world?An EasyJet Holidays spokeswoman said: \"We recognise that many of our customers do still want their holidays to go ahead, so for 'amber' list destinations where holidays can be enjoyed safely and legally, which do not have 'all but essential travel' warnings and where there is no quarantine requirement in destination, we are providing flexibility and choice so customers can make up their own mind about their holiday.\"She added that EasyJet would not operate any holidays to destinations on the \"red\" list.On Wednesday, online travel agent On The Beach <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-57084732> said it had stopped selling all holidays for this summer because of Covid uncertainty.Chief executive Simon Cooper told the BBC that many would-be holidaymakers had been \"jaded by the experience\" of summer 2020, when many holidays that had been booked failed to take place because of shifting travel restrictions.Mr Cooper added that if On The Beach did go ahead with summer bookings, its profits risked being outweighed by \"administrative costs and loss of goodwill\"."}
