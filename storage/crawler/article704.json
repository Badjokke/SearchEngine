You can't just leave him with someone who doesn't know his needs.\"Disability charity Contact said its survey of 3,000 UK families with disabled children found 33% had to quit a job due to a lack of childcare or respite care.Menna Machreth from the charity Mudiad Meithrin - the main provider of Welsh-medium early years care and education - said settings often wanted to welcome every child, but there was not \"the support there or the extra hands\".She said the Welsh government needed to give \"more sustainable answers about the way ahead\".The Welsh government recently announced £18m to strengthen support for children and young people with additional learning needs.However, Jenny Rathbone Labour Member of the Senedd <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-wales-politics-52442634> and committe chairwoman, said the fall in childcare places was \"really staggering\" and disabled children had suffered as a result of the pandemic.She said local authorities needed to \"think more\" about how to support families.The WLGA said councils were eager to learn lessons and ensure there were improvements, and were looking forward to working with ministers to strengthen provision.The Welsh government said: \"We provide more than £1.5m a year in support for children with additional needs within thechildcare offer <https:\/\/gov.wales\/childcare-offer-for-wales-campaign>, and grants of up to £10,000 are available to make settings accessible.\"This year we have also allocated £5m for local authorities to create accessible play opportunities.\""}
