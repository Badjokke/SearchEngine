Mike says it's one of the reasons Mexico was chosen as the new setting.\"You don't get that far down the path of trying to make a big world for players before realising there's no point making it - if it's just going to have more of the same.\"We need diversity in our game and Mexico is almost like the whole world in one country.\"It's got snowy mountains, volcanoes, epic canyons and beautiful historic cities - it also has farmland, deserts and jungles.\"And so when asked if bigger is always better, Mike replies: \"I think so. \"When we look at how people play horizon, they explore the open world and they hang out with their friends.\"The bigger space they can hang out, the more they can explore - I do think that a bigger horizon game will be more fun for people.\"With such an emphasis on playing together, more companies like Forza Horizon developer, Playground Games, are coming up with ways for making sure online interactions are not toxic.\"A goal that we have is that every interaction you have with another person should be at least neutral but ideally positive,\" says Mike.\"We do a lot to try and try and get in the mind of a troll, to see how people interact with each other.\"We've developed some features that use artificial intelligence to link you with others - and because it knows about the players, it's able to suggest gameplay based on the things it is confident you're going to want to do together.\"Mike says that many of their game modes don't have negative outcomes and these positive experiences, alongside the new AI technology, will help create a \"friendly, accessible and inclusive online space.\"Players will get to find out in November how much of an impact these new features will make.It's also when Mike and the team will get to see if players agree that bigger really does mean better in gaming.For more gaming content head to Press X To Continue on BBC Sounds. <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sounds\/search?q=press+x>"}
