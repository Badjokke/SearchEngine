They said NRW have agreed to undertake wider testing.The firm also found that \"while progress has been made [by NRW] in addressing issues raised in previous internal and external reviews, not all matters have been addressed\".In a wide-ranging review Grant Thornton also found: <https:\/\/naturalresources.wales\/about-us\/strategies-and-plans\/governance-of-timber-sales\/?lang=en>NRW chief executive Clare Pillman, who joined in February 2018, told BBC Wales what had happened with the timber contracts was \"indefensible\".She said: \"We know that we have to get this right and the board of NRW is providing strong direction and support to this project.\"I told our annual meeting with the timber industry recently that I feel a new era is dawning in Wales.\"Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price AM called for the Welsh Government to step in and \"conduct any further investigation so we can finally have a comprehensive picture as a basis for actually putting an action plan into place so we can move forward\".Welsh Conservatives environment spokesman Andrew RT Davies said it was time for the Welsh Government to take responsibility for NRW's \"disastrous merger\" which is \"failing its duty to the Welsh public\".A Welsh Government spokesman said NRW was already making the necessary changes to its commercial timber operations and putting systems in place to \"make sure this does not happen again\".Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths will be meeting the interim chair and chief executive this week to discuss the Grant Thornton review, he added."}
