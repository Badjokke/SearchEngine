They choose a minimum exclusion period of either six months, one year, or five years.There has been a rise since lockdown began in people asking Gamstop for their self-exclusion to be reversed but once registered, the system does not allow them to cancel until the minimum period they originally chose, has expired.In the past 30 days, searches for casinos not on Gamstop however have also increased, according to Google.Gamstop said this was a sign \"in one sense that the new regulatory system was working\".\"However, it is obviously irresponsible for anyone to promote unlicensed websites that are not regulated by the Gambling Commission and consumers are strongly advised not to use them,\" it said.Gamblers Anonymous said it did not remove the temptation by stopping using credit cards when gambling.\"It just makes it a bit more difficult,\" it said. \"If a compulsive gambler wishes to gamble online, they will find a way.\"Steve said systems set up by gambling companies to protect customers were purely \"tick-box exercises\" but \"99% of operators\" were covered by Gamstop.The commission said it had suspended the operating licences of two operators whoinitially failed to sign up to Gamstop <https:\/\/www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk\/news-action-and-statistics\/News\/gambling-commission-suspend-two-operator-licences-for-failure-to-participate-in-gamstop>.Where it saw individuals or companies not licensed in Britain, illegally interacting with British consumers, it said it would act to close them down.It said it expected operators to step in when they saw evidence of gambling-related harm and to carry out checks on people's source of funds.\"We take failures to do this extremely seriously,\" the commission said.If you or someone you know has been affected by addiction, help and support is available atbbc.co.uk\/actionline <https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/actionline>.The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.For more information on methodology, click here <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1n-Ymy3ymz674T4aaoof8fw50oCedwLnjCzzUDEvgrME\/edit?usp=sharing>.
